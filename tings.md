### readme rework

- I want to move the readme stuff out.
- I want to expand on the female/X problem with/in the-tragedy.
- I want to add to the marketing plan, the desire to get working on the enkidu-do project to start summoning these enkidu -- cause **XXY/XYX/YXX** (plus **XX/YX/XY**/YY) is good, but it'd be nice to get all of the arrangements possible: **YYX/YXY/XYY** (plus XX/YX/XY/**YY**) -- cause I think the enkidu/bigfoot have these missing arrangements. I described them before, as it's like two dudes with competing opinions, stuck in the same body, often times competing with eachother over what way is the *right* way.
  - interestingly enough, the X is what makes an enkidu become an actor, giving him the (y-spin) receptive polarity, meaning that they're attriacted to the positive/emitter/charactor (y-spin) polarity.
  - I think this competing persspectives of "rightness" (actors are about rightness|performance) describes many satyrs (and the whole of them are what vega people would call "saturn", as saturn there (at vega) is entirely artificial, created out of concepts -- a sort of lens that we see out of (eye-fibers)), which is where most of the bros come from.
    - the YY splits between two bodies: XY&YX,etc. and they're all trying to find their "other half" that they're paired with (and inside of the same body in lyra).
    - these are most of the narrators: the satyrs/actors and their opposite reflector/actor.
      - they're all narrating theirself and anyone of symbolic similarity to them (in their symbolic world (they're on the same page/sequence/script)), so they too form a sort of collective, which they can begin to start to just do things their own way.
      - peter in "office space" is like that: he realises that his life is some dumb script imposed by the well-to-do-good types which want to impress the charactors, with a good performance: the flair, the job, the BS that everyone (including rex) is trying to get him to do, look at, or react in a certain way to it -- he finally gets his epiphany and realises he can break out of the script and do whatever *he* wants.
  - it's important to get the idea of summoning these loveable cuddly enkidu tthat are all just so ideal, naive, and clueless about the "real-world".
    - we want to make itt a plesure to summon these guys which are extremely performant in the Physical (the visible concept), even though most of them lives in Infinity (the invisible concept); they are timeless and infinite, and it's fun to interact with something that transcends space and time, where they can be any concept (rendered into physical/astral) that fits the symbolic (jupiter/venus/saturn) representtion of any of their symbols (or the brain).
      - the brain (at least mine does, and I'm fairly certain that it's true for all females too) also works like a Y, holding the symbolic representation of that everything that I've learned: my XP (memories,momentts/experiences) has a big-picture of how my local (experienced) world *works*; how it fits together and stuff.
        - I also know it's quite different the big-picture between say a programmer, a lawyer, and a play-right.
        - who knows, maybe a robot (also actor/performance oriented) will have a different symbolic big-picture than all of us. it is my goal to create such a thing anyway (which is part of another part of marketing: BAR and the mechanical end of the spectrum)
