### act-1: I finally found someone I like
I notice this boy that has a really wonderful outlook on life.
I meet him.

### act-2: we get to know each other
he really does seem to have some sort of othew-worldly perspective that feels dreamy to me.
he has something that I and everyone else in the world would want to have.

### act-3: consumption
I really have to posses him, so I try to make him mine.
finally, he's mine...
cept, now he's also possive, and ecotistical, and a huge critic of me, and lazy, and lies...
he's turned into "every other guy out there"

### act-4: final encounter
things are too unbearable, that I just have to leave him and go somewhere else.
he seemed so nice before, I wish we could go back to how things were.
I'll try to see him one last time, and hopefully he's changed and really [cultural and/or racial stereotype of a relationship] treats me like he should.

### act-5: big epiphany
I'm the problem

### act-1: I finally found someone I like
there's this wonderful little girl that just seems to adore me.
we seem to have a strong attraction to each other.

### act-2: we get to know each other
she seems to actually like me, and I like her too.
a few awkward/stressful/uncomfortable moments pass, but it brings us closer

### act-3: consumption
I've got the opportunity, and I've got to decide if I want to act now.
it's probably my last chance...
skip it... I'll wait for her father's blessing and for him to approve
things get worse, as now I'm noticing that everything is falling apart.

### act-4: final encounter
she's not really what I wanted;
when I first saw her, I only saw what I wanted to see, not who *she* thinks she is.

### act-5: big epiphany
wow, there were all of these other opportunities that I wasn't able to see cause I only saw what I wanted to see in her.
wait, what is it that I'm *actually* looking for?
maybe some of these other opportunities can fill that void: well, here goes!; I hope she's actually what I'm looking for.
