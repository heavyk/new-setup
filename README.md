> the purest of desires, is epic tragedy

> epic tragedy, evokes the most and purest desires in the audience

over the last new days (2023-06-04 12:29), I've been thinking a lot about what it is exactly that I want to *do*, and so here's the game-plan: I've got the greatest tragedy possible in all of this universe planned out. check this out: I'll give over this respository and everything in it so that "authorised" versions can be created, for the visually stimulated, and "authorized" versions can be produced to validate its textual authenticity
  cause whatever was written down a long ttime ago, and is believed/looked in by many, has atrraction weight, and so therefore, one can simply *use* this literary energy, just simply by referencing or evoking the concept in one's own literary works
    I do this naturally, because so many things connect, it's hard *not* to see the symbolic similarities between some things.
  means that anyone with access to the "authorized" versions can use the text In a powerful way.
it is *desirable*, to many people to be left in the dark on something: they don't want to see the universe in such an expanding yet attracting kind of way, so they just want the story to tell them how all the pieces fit together. all of that nonsense to me, falls away so long as I keep perceiving further and further depth:
  you know, that if you were to isolate any single person on the planet, and make the scenery invisible, I see that the person has a glow of perception around them: the world that they see is illuminated as a reflection of them. when we see the same glow, and our perceptions don't give the same reasons/narration of how the pieces fit together, it creates conflict, cause anyone with a Y (see [enkidu-do](/enkidu-do.md)), has the "right way" that everything works out (according to their the-manual). anyone who has the-manual all figrured out (anyone with a Y), is constantly comparing their version with *perceived* reality, and trying to predict/explain why everything is the way it is.
therefore, if your the-manual is different than mine, we'll have massive conflicts cause of LOA.
  this is a pretty big problem for me, because I've noticed that my reality around certain very (physically/conceptually) attractive people, reality manifestts in very weird ways, and so I notice that some flubbs are desired to be hidden. I tend to manifest the irritating,annoying&peevish things that one could do
    it has to do with the expectations felt be someone with similar vibrations. for example, myself I exhibit a lot of vibrations that would be similar to a sales person, schmoozer, or nieve, or easily excitable about some new idea -- type person, but a lot of people have certain expectations of those frequencies, so they manifest in the form of "hey jaron, are you ready to start... [some sales jargon BS]" and then keep it up for a while -- because like a really sleazy sales person, I *LOVE* to find ways to sell useless stuff. it's one of my pet passions, so I feel like a sleezy sales person to a lot of people, and it creates interesting interactions I couldn't have planned.
      the reason for this is because I learned all of these qualities in my male role models when I was in spain -- but ultimately didn't like their implementation very much -- so I'm full spanish sleeze, but I do it differently than they would (though my vibration is the same)
    I ultimately find the best way to look at something, which turns out (for those watching me) I find good *actions*/implementations of a thing/concept that's considered unwanted/evil, which for me have nothing to do with action; I simply feel the way I want to feel and actions don't matter to me.
  so whatt ends up happening, is I start doing the imitations of the other guys better than them -- and most people don't really like to be "shown up" --
    but that's an attitude only a person that's not moving could have.
  so most people try to "hold me back" cause they feel some sort of jealusy/hatred/envy that I can do the imitation of them and feel better about literally everything -- and all their effort in trying to hold someone else back (or steer their car, they're only holding theirself back: everything, they don't want for me, they don't want for theirselves)
therefore, what I want to do is to enable them full control to steer my vehicle: like, I will live out the most "tragic" tragedy ever (it's my one opportunity, and I just *have* to do it -- it's such a good story because nobody in my place would ever pick a tragedy, because they think symbolically), and in everyone that sees that as tragedy, emits the purest form of desire in response saying, "man, I would have done that differently" -- well here's everyone's chance.
  for me, all of this is just me showing off how great it is to be feeling the way I want to feel, that tragedy isn't even apparent; let me explain: tragedy is just a misinterpretation (translation) of the symbols, into concept (and then later physical), and the way that something *feels* (physically) is related to the brain's astral/conceptal structures as perceived in the physical body. the way a tragedy *feels* (conceptually) is the most abstract pure, "zero-point" energy that one can possibly have.
    yes, so the saturnian symbolic perspective runs entirely on tragedy (and other misinterpretations of vibration, like "romance" and "word-play"). so whenever someone is using that "zero-point" energy percepction, it's founded on tragedy to get its energy: because its haighest most energetic concepts are these purely abstract/lofty ideas/ideals that can *never* be instantiated into physical, but because the idea *feels* so good (conceptually, and possibly physically), we continue to try and make the impossible (*in 3d*) to happen.
      it's a very impossible to reach goal, much like the desire inside of women to find on the outside what is inside of them (but not expressed because of destructive interference) --
      so, like all centres, I want to stay in one place and to move effortlessly (that is, everything is perceived as relative to me), so that means that I want to be as "zero-point" (tragic) as possible: the most tragic of concepts, are the highest of frequency ones: the ones that can never find a physical implementation, but they feel so good, so we want the manifestation of this (impossible) thing really bad: the purest of vibrations.
