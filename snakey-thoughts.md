first of all, her akashic records is the outside-in (symbolic) perspective of the spectral (+-4) in my system. I don't see it visually, so I don't have any of the experiences that she's talking about -- *and* I don't have to be specific about my wording or rules, because I've found that the wording ("best and highest good") is something that visual people need to do to *imagine* what those symbols mean -- because let's say the practitioner just got off a phone call, and they were talking to someone about something other than the highest and greatest good (something like a compromise/tradeoff, pros and cons, or an undeniable/unavoidable "reality" of a situation), whell that'll carry over into the session -- and so when she's specifically invoking the words, "best and highest good", she's tuning *herself* to see/receive that kind of information. it's not strictly necessary to use those words exactly, for me because all I have to do is to feel (or want) that I'm receiving someone's greatest/highest/best good for them. my emotional state is where my reception is at (it's the filter in front of the lens, as she said)... that said, for me it's all a reception process, which put a few thoughts

- regarding inputting programming into someone else's records, I can guarantee you that anyone who tries to input malicious code into someone else's symbolic/emotional mind (cause the physical one has been kept busy), is only hurting theirselves.
  - let's assume that I get into the mind of someone else (I don't need permission because I'm low enough resistance that they can't block me), and I start to put ideas/narrative into their head that they should expect this/that or the other thing to happen; well, I'm the one casting the spell, and because their conscious mind is asleep (just like during sleep), the waveform is very flat (not much activity), and the less activity it has, the more it's a mirror to myself. the malicious ones (if there are any -- cause they're only fighting their own beliefs) would actually only be able to be somewhat successful if they keep the conscious mind engaged into something pretty desirable (like a nice beach or sex or something), and it's that physical/visual symbolic aspect that produces the good-feeling emotions, which hides the bad-feeling of the suggestions/expectations that they're programming in. suggestions/expectations are some part desire, and some part belief, so the "malicious" practitioner is attracting the malicious stuff on theirselves.
  - usually anything perceived as malicious by the subject is their own perception, and not the practitioner. I wouldn't expect the "malicious" practitioners to last too long, as their creating many as many problems for theirselves as they are for their victims. they would need an incredible budget/media capacity to be able to physically hold their own attracted malice away from theirself.
  - the elephant in the room here are large beaurocracies and institutions, which (IMO) only exist because they're *actually* part of everyones best and highest intention to become individualised, an entity to theirself, fully self-identified and defined. someone like that, the malicious programmers will have no effect anymore on (like agent smith on neo)
- regarding "do I want to move to toledo" being a not very good question, vs "is moving to toledo going to support my life goals and happiness"... I always ask the first question, because I find the second one to be problematic. I call the difference between the first question, "is it what I *really* want", and the second, "is it what I *think* I want" (pure-desire vs calculated-desire) -- because I've found that the first question may not get the instant results, and so therefore could be perceived to have lower performance/success in my calculated/symbolic mind, but ultimately those are kind of like small traps or detours that take me away from the pure-desire/direct/shortest/fastest path -- which are actually all just fine because it's all about having fun along the journey, not getting to the destination as quick as possible. often times the greatest rewards require the most personal character change in me to be able to even allow them, and so if I were to have gotten caught up on all the detours along the way, I wouldn't know what I know now.
  - me personally, I like to attain the knowledge/understanding *first* before getting the manifestation, because I'm so used to foiling myself by not actually knowing what I want (or believing the narrative about what I think I should want). ----- it is weird that the shortest/fastest/best way is also the one with the most capacity for wanted, because it's now a reflection of me (perfection: no distortion; a perfect channel of all that's wanted/desired into physical/reality).
- the onion is the layers of the unconscious programming/beliefs that we see/perceive the world out of: stacks and stacks of dirty lenses.
  - I consider/relate the onion to be the symbolic/visual perception (beliefs and experiences/traumas put them there), but the potato is the emotional/feeling mind. it's much more cloudlike, and doesn't have such well-defined shapes/purposes, but is more cloud-like based more on intution/movement/rhythm.
- regarding the part where she says that instead of sending her etheric (imaginary) body out into the ethers and letting her mouth move (like a channeler in a trance), she has a remote internet cOnnection allowing her to be preseent in the body, fully grounded... the way that I experience this is that what she's calling the etheric body is what I call the imagination or astral (6), which is going to fully take over all of the physical senses, like an open-eyes vision -- and when that happens, my imagination is interpretting the concepts in their "records" (ie, their conceptual vibration) and turning that into symboically meaningful (to her) physical objects that can affect any of her/my physical senses. I'm literally inside of their body, having their experience as they're having it. like she says, it's a strong experience (depeding on how much resistance I have), and the emotional/intentional effects that I'm having on her body would normally produce visuals and everything -- but she's just learned to not let (her perception of) the other person's emotional/conceptual state/vibration to take over all of her 5 senses. she's able to (like on a powerful ayahuasca experience), control how much of that other conceptual atmosphere to affect or manifest into her symbolic/physical experience.
  - regarding this further: I claim that satan/saturn/dumuzi is the (narrated name for the) one that's kind of like in charge of this source/akashic records for anyone, and that his job is to make sure that everything is balanced and properly accessed (so he's not really "bad" -- but is kind of like king of "the opposition" -- ie, the devil). the devil/satan/saturn does not want someone to access their christ/solar (centre of the head) consciousness, without having acquired the emotional capacity (found in the solar-plexus/gut), in order to be able to see everything as expansive: imagination shrinks/confines the emotion into a physical/symbolic form, spectral is a mirror, so everything I do to anyone in the akashic record (helping or harming), I'm doing to myself, and solar/relational consciousness is seeing how everything fits together, and everthing is always becoming more/better/good. I like to think of it as imagination is good vs evil. spectral is evil balancing good (redemption,healing,etc) and solar is only good -- and that's simply because solar perception is *MUCH MUCH* further in both time and space -- so *at scale*, everything (the whole) is actually becoming something greater than it is in a previous state.
- regarding the aura and the protective bubble. first of all, I'm a person that (before I lost my pinecone) saw auras quite easily, and I can still "see" them today, but without the pinecone (the interal mind's eye, related to the pineal), I still perceive it -- and so without the colour which gives meaning, I feel/receive the emotion/concept that directly relates to what their trauma/emotional/conceptual blockage is. I am, like one of those sponges that she was talking about, someone who absorbs everything around me, and I too had to find a way to *discern* what's my emotion/concept and what is other people's or even the environmental effects (like corporate office is different than bank, which is different than home, and different than garden/woods -- for example).
  - that process of learning to discern what is mine and what is not mine, is simple in that the stuff that *feels* like it's mine (or produces any sensation/reaction in any way), is something that resonates with me, and so even if it's not exactly mine, I'm still receptive to it.
  - my experience is that building a barrier or bubble to protect me, doesn't actually protect me (no matter how clean it may be) -- and actually, to be honest, the cleaner my bubble is, the more disastrous the next time a symbolic entity (like a thought) or an emotion can penetrate my bubble. so, I don't really worry so much on trying to constantly keep it clean -- but instead to not attract (resonate with) the dust in the first place -- and if it is dirty (it always is), then how quickly can I recover and get back to clean again. inotherwords, cleaning for me is a reactionary process, not an active process, because the active process is actually attracting more cleaning. (ever notice how the windshield or the car gets dirty really quickly after a wash -- yet others seem to be able to drive a car and it doesn't seem to get so dirty so quickly? I posit that it's the continual cleaning (and the enjoyment of it) that attracts situations which require more cleaning -- cause everyone loves the release/constrast that the clean gives in comparison tto the dirty).
    - my barrier or bubble is so large now, that it's probably at least the size of the earth, which means I absorb *all* things on earth: a super sponge. make it so that nothing can bother you, so you too can be one with the earth. for me, I don't need to have the golden rope, cause I'm already there already with the earth. I would imagine that these super-sponge kids are also like that too -- so my advise to them would be, "you're already connected, so notice the things/times that you're disconnected and change how you perceive those things/events/circumstances, to keep the connection" -- and of course, it'll take them a few times of losing the connection before they desire to get it back, which is OK (for me it was a car accident, a relationship, and a few other things that brought me to desire to keep that physical/earth connection). everyone has to desire (for theirselves) to keep that connection. I have no control over how big my bubble is, and I imagine a lot of these really sensitive kids don't either; so, my advise is not to try and gain control over the bubble (the lens everyone else sees me through), but to instead focus on my perception (the lens that I see everyone else through). the good news is, all these kids will figure out they have no control over the size of their bubble, and only on the clarity/resistance they're seeing outward/inward through.
    - I'm not saying that clearing is bad, just that as sensitivity increases, clearing will neeed to be done more and more frequently, so in a sense the clearing is good practise to notice what things feel good to absorb and what things don't. if it feels good, I'll let the mental/conceptual sequence play out for a while -- and if it feels bad, I sometimes let it play out a while so I can find the resonance with me, and fix that. it depends on the person's definition of clearing -- but I imagine it (for some people) is like washing the car and then driving through the same muddy ditch a few hours later, and then wondering wth they find themselves needing another carwash so soon ("didn't I just go to the carwash?! it should still be clean!", they cry in oblivious agony, not realising they're the one attracted to driving the vehicle into the ditch).
- regarding hypnosis, I had a friend that did hypnotism on me, and because I don't have a mind's eye (pinecone), I just played along and told him what was at the top of the stairs, in the house, whatever (it was a lot like playing those role-playing games), but I never got into a trance or saw anything -- and just told them the next concept that popped into my mind. (the first session I tried) as this is happening, I'm realsing that the stuff that I'm telling him (but can't actually see) are making tons of symbolic sense, and that every time he asked me what I saw, I revealed another symbolic aspect of how I see (not visually, more like perceive) some aspect of a trauma that had happened in my past. his sessions were incredibly eye-opening for me, and I went home the first day and said, "I can do that to myself" -- so I did. I cut out the different visual transitions like going up stairs or walking in the door to just the feeling aspect (going higher, or moving through a threshold/barrier), and can now (for almost everything) figure out what it is that is the "root" of the perception without having to go through such a long visual experience.
  - though I'd mastered his skill after 3-4 sessions, I still continued on with the sessions, because working with another person, he often times didn't go the way *I* would have gone (in the conceptual journey), and it resulted in a lot of new/novel understanding about myself that I wouldn't have otherwise picked up. we also became pretty good friends too, though I haven't seen him in a while (we live in different countries now). it was still quite enjoyable (for me at least) to let someone else take the narrator/navigator position and take me on a different journey. talk about someone being like a "plant" (or guide in my life), because next I also felt inspired to ask him if we could look inside of each others eyes for an extended period of time (15+ minutes), and that's how I figured out about the onion/lens thing -- and that experience helped me to figure out that we're all looking through our own lenses, and everyone sees me through my aura/lens as well. I have no idea what he saw looking into me or through my lens (cause I never asked), but I had gotten to the inner-most part of his onion, and I can now feel/"see" myself from his/my perspective (cause we were kind of like sharing a body/connection that I'd only previously ever experienced during sex) and the onion is very interesting because on the outer layers (let's say for example he thinks I'm frivelous or something, maybe a little deeper conceited/hawty or vain, but in the deepost part of the onion, *everyone* loves everyone else, and when I can feel the love for myself (by seeing from the inner onion), seems others are also able to see me and theirselves that way too). eye looking is anyway, those kinds of guided meditations/realisations/hypnosis are extremely beneficial, and I highly recommend. it's good to have friends that open to doing that kinda airy-fairy hippy stuff.
    - IMO eye looking is more powerful than hypnosis, and I get hypnotised all the time by people's eyes, becausE I immediately feel everything they have going on in their emotional being. it distracts me and keeps my conscious mind busy, as if I'm staring with my jaw open with awe and wonder at a movie (though I can't see anything). I know my eyes have a dramatic effect on others, so I wonder what it would be like for me to do a guided journey with someone where they look into my eyes, and I allow them access to the inner parts of my onion so they can see/feel their symbolic/self perspective, from my inner-most core/divine/universal/centre being/consciousness. (I'm strongly reminded of the "world in my eyes" song by depeche mode, hehe). I'd love to try it some day with someone that's willing (it could be a pretty intense/pleasureful/scary ride though, depending on their emotional state, cause I can't control what they see, only how I feel).
- regarding astrology, I like to think of the planets and their positions in relation to each other, the earth, and the sun are sortof like a long never-ending musical arrangement, and when you're born, you're born "en media res" (in the middle of the song), and depending on where that song starts kinda sets the "tone" for one's life. that "tone" is what I call consider default symbolic behaviour. imagine a time, let's say way way back (around the time of the composition of the illiad), and humans had very little consciousness back then; a bunch of automatons running around completely subject to the whims of the "gods" (planets), and so you can imagine the brain is like a neural network with a number of different inputs which influence whether the brain/automaton will "decide" one way or another. the different impulses that correspond to all of the symbolic/action detail (as determined/predicted by astrology) which is present in the automaton is going to directly correlate to how much consciousness capability they have to override the planet's influence on their decision-making process. tthe more conscious the person, the less accurate their astrological reading. by the same token (flip the coin over) and the less resistance a person has, the more they're going to be "in alignment" with the planets and stars, because now a unfavourable alignment doesn't throw them off as much, and so a triple square t-bone alignment isn't gonna send them spinning, and so with less resistance, it's possible for three seemingly unrelated thing to kindof line up and what would (for others with high resistance) be a paradigm shattering alignment, now turns into a nice alignment where things work out nicely. the planets are like the musical flow to the solar system, and someone with low resistance (like the sun, which is the lowest resistance of us all), is going with the flow; yet someone with high resistance is resisting the flow, and so therefore is much more strongly affected, for both good and bad.
  - I'm quite sensitive to stars' and planets' energies, and I notice that with low resistance, all of the days are a total breeze, and then the aligned days (both the "bad" and "good" ones) are like accents or particularly more notable days -- not so much for me personally, because most things are pretty smoothe, but in contrast/comparison to the rest of the world, which then that contrast seems to highlight those alignments and make them more meaningful to others, thereby making them more meaningful to me, as well.
  - astrology is kinda like the conductor in the front flailing his arms around amplifying some sounds/tones and diminishing others (as he desires them to be), even though the (celestial) orchestra doing all the work. the conductor is just putting that editing/temporal emphasis/touch on it the music before it reaches the audience's ears/reality/present.
