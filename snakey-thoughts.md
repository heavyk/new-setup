first of all, her akashic records is the outside-in (symbolic) perspective of the spectral (+-4) in my system. I don't see it visually, so I don't have any of the experiences that she's talking about -- *and* I don't have to be specific about my wording or rules, because I've found that the wording ("best and highest good") is something that visual people need to do to *imagine* what those symbols mean -- because let's say the practitioner just got off a phone call, and they were talking to someone about something other than the highest and greatest good (something like a compromise/tradeoff, pros and cons, or an undeniable/unavoidable "reality" of a situation), whell that'll carry over into the session -- and so when she's specifically invoking the words, "best and highest good", she's tuning *herself* to see/receive that kind of information. it's not strictly necessary to use those words exactly, for me because all I have to do is to feel (or want) that I'm receiving someone's greatest/highest/best good for them. my emotional state is where my reception is at (it's the filter in front of the lens, as she said)... that said, for me it's all a reception process, which put a few thoughts

- regarding inputting programming into someone else's records, I can guarantee you that anyone who tries to input malicious code into someone else's symbolic/emotional mind (cause the physical one has been kept busy), is only hurting theirselves.
    - let's assume that I get into the mind of someone else (I don't need permission because I'm low enough resistance that they can't block me), and I start to put ideas/narrative into their head that they should expect this/that or the other thing to happen; well, I'm the one casting the spell, and because their conscious mind is asleep (just like during sleep), the waveform is very flat (not much activity), and the less activity it has, the more it's a mirror to myself. the malicious ones (if there are any -- cause they're only fighting their own beliefs) would actually only be able to be somewhat successful if they keep the conscious mind engaged into something pretty desirable (like a nice beach or sex or something), and it's that physical/visual symbolic aspect that produces the good-feeling emotions, which hides the bad-feeling of the suggestions/expectations that they're programming in. suggestions/expectations are some part desire, and some part belief, so the "malicious" practitioner is attracting the malicious stuff on theirselves.
    - usually anything perceived as malicious by the subject is their own perception, and not the practitioner. I wouldn't expect the "malicious" practitioners to last too long, as their creating many as many problems for theirselves as they are for their victims. they would need an incredible budget/media capacity to be able to physically hold their own attracted malice away from theirself.
    - the elephant in the room here are large beaurocracies and institutions, which (IMO) only exist because they're *actually* part of everyones best and highest intention to become individualised, an entity to theirself, fully self-identified and defined. someone like that, the malicious programmers will have no effect anymore on (like agent smith on neo)
- regarding "do I want to move to toledo" being a not very good question, vs "is moving to toledo going to support my life goals and happiness"... I always ask the first question, because I find the second one to be problematic. I call the difference between the first question, "is it what I *really* want", and the second, "is it what I *think* I want" (pure-desire vs calculated-desire) -- because I've found that the first question may not get the instant results, and so therefore could be perceived to have lower performance/success in my calculated/symbolic mind, but ultimately those are kind of like small traps or detours that take me away from the pure-desire/direct/shortest/fastest path -- which are actually all just fine because it's all about having fun along the journey, not getting to the destination as quick as possible. often times the greatest rewards require the most personal character change in me to be able to even allow them, and so if I were to have gotten caught up on all the detours along the way, I wouldn't know what I know now.
    - me personally, I like to attain the knowledge/understanding *first* before getting the manifestation, because I'm so used to foiling myself by not actually knowing what I want (or believing the narrative about what I think I should want). ----- it is weird that the shortest/fastest/best way is also the one with the most capacity for wanted, because it's now a reflection of me (perfection: no distortion; a perfect channel of all that's wanted/desired into physical/reality).
