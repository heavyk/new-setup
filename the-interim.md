### 2023-06-20 14:01 - the waiting game

I explained in [the-problem](/the-problem.md) what I think is the problem with genetics and stuff, which is the conclusion that I've come to combining a lot of different sources (from tesla to the bible), along with my own experience on what I believe is happening, and why the "every guy is like this" (jock/bro) types seem to contiually win out, and why humankind and society is still running on a sumerian social-conceptual-framework.
there isn't much that I can personally do to change any of it, as it's every person for theirselves choosing a different perspective on life -- and since I can't really change how anyone thinks or sees the world, I plan to leave everything exactly how it is. only the ones that resonate with me will find me -- and since I'm pretty plant-like in nature, I follow the same rules: I have to figure out how to get/attract the things I want and have those that benefit from my pollen/fruit/whatever, to come to me. I really don't plan on trying to be assertive and to get anyone tto think or believe any way that I do. they're fine how they are, and I don't want to mess with them.
the next obvious thing is that *clearly* nobody actually wants me to get the ability to manipulate genetics, because all of that technology is top secret, *and* they definitely don't want more copies of me running around, either. so, they're going to fight that pretty hard, I'm sure. I titled this "the waiting game" because I refuse to tell others how to think and what to do, so they have to come to me ultimately. I did my great effort and emailed allison, and no response -- so I imagine that was good enough to make it known that anyone wanting to work on any of my ideas can easily contact me, and I'll give them my blessing, unless I'm feeling like I want to be involved too -- but that's kind of a pretty big problem because the minute that I get involved, I'm now telling people what to do and how to think -- so it probably won't happen like that at all.

for now, what I'm deciding to do is -- I'll probably just play captain of industry, because I enjoy the game -- but, I probably won't be streaming it because I'm not really into the mutual-back-scratching sort of thing (ref: conversation with greg yesterday) and I don't really want to be making money, until probably I've got a company and a direction -- which then it'll be the company that's making money, not me.
  I have some ideas on how I want to play coi as well, and my goal will be to find a way to play coi without using a mouse and keyboard. I wanted to do this with BAR, but ultimately I don't think it's my style of game anymore, because it's all about domination, and then I have to play online *against* other people to test my code and see how it performs in the wild. with coi, I'm not competing against anyone except for myself, and I can rate how well the program is working, not based on domination but things like aesthetics, stability, and stuff like that (which is nicer to me).
I did consider streaming, but I think you need two working hemispheres to be able to talk and play a game, so instead why not just do a chatting stream? it'd be boring, I'm sure, but at least I won't be answereing the question poorly *and* playing the game poorly at the same time. I prefer to answer the questions well. also, I'd then be competing with other streamers and youtube creators -- which I don't want to do. I just want to play the game for fun, and work on some of the ideas that I have based around spreadsheets (ref: conversation with jaron about gary). so, if I stream, I'll do a just chatting stream -- but realistically that's likely never to happen, as I don't really care. if there were people with questions, they would have asked them already, so it's silly.

alright, off to play coi and start learning to program again.
  I'll come back to this back-story sometime in the future: when I'm ready to write the full narrative,-- and when that happens I'll hopefully have learned enough programming and automated management skills, that I'll be able to start doing everything with machines (that would be pretty cool, anyway). if that goes through, I'll want to start making money so I can buy servers, and stuff so I can begin building my own websites and stuff (assuming everything is automated, I can at least work on a few pet projects before selling them off to google(?) or anyone that wants them).
