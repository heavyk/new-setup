### 2023-06-20 14:01 - the waiting game

I explained in [the-problem](/the-problem.md) what I think is the problem with genetics and stuff, which is the conclusion that I've come to combining a lot of different sources (from tesla to the bible), along with my own experience on what I believe is happening, and why the "every guy is like this" (jock/bro) types seem to contiually win out, and why humankind and society is still running on a sumerian social-conceptual-framework.
there isn't much that I can personally do to change any of it, as it's every person for theirselves choosing a different perspective on life -- and since I can't really change how anyone thinks or sees the world, I plan to leave everything exactly how it is. only the ones that resonate with me will find me -- and since I'm pretty plant-like in nature, I follow the same rules: I have to figure out how to get/attract the things I want and have those that benefit from my pollen/fruit/whatever, to come to me. I really don't plan on trying to be assertive and to get anyone tto think or believe any way that I do. they're fine how they are, and I don't want to mess with them.
the next obvious thing is that *clearly* nobody actually wants me to get the ability to manipulate genetics, because all of that technology is top secret, *and* they definitely don't want more copies of me running around, either. so, they're going to fight that pretty hard, I'm sure. I titled this "the waiting game" because I refuse to tell others how to think and what to do, so they have to come to me ultimately. I did my great effort and emailed allison, and no response -- so I imagine that was good enough to make it known that anyone wanting to work on any of my ideas can easily contact me, and I'll give them my blessing, unless I'm feeling like I want to be involved too -- but that's kind of a pretty big problem because the minute that I get involved, I'm now telling people what to do and how to think -- so it probably won't happen like that at all.

for now, what I'm deciding to do is -- I'll probably just play captain of industry, because I enjoy the game -- but, I probably won't be streaming it because I'm not really into the mutual-back-scratching sort of thing (ref: conversation with greg yesterday) and I don't really want to be making money, until probably I've got a company and a direction -- which then it'll be the company that's making money, not me.
  I have some ideas on how I want to play coi as well, and my goal will be to find a way to play coi without using a mouse and keyboard. I wanted to do this with BAR, but ultimately I don't think it's my style of game anymore, because it's all about domination, and then I have to play online *against* other people to test my code and see how it performs in the wild. with coi, I'm not competing against anyone except for myself, and I can rate how well the program is working, not based on domination but things like aesthetics, stability, and stuff like that (which is nicer to me).
I did consider streaming, but I think you need two working hemispheres to be able to talk and play a game, so instead why not just do a chatting stream? it'd be boring, I'm sure, but at least I won't be answereing the question poorly *and* playing the game poorly at the same time. I prefer to answer the questions well. also, I'd then be competing with other streamers and youtube creators -- which I don't want to do. I just want to play the game for fun, and work on some of the ideas that I have based around spreadsheets (ref: conversation with jaron about gary). so, if I stream, I'll do a just chatting stream -- but realistically that's likely never to happen, as I don't really care. if there were people with questions, they would have asked them already, so it's silly.

alright, off to play coi and start learning to program again.
  I'll come back to this back-story sometime in the future: when I'm ready to write the full narrative,-- and when that happens I'll hopefully have learned enough programming and automated management skills, that I'll be able to start doing everything with machines (that would be pretty cool, anyway). if that goes through, I'll want to start making money so I can buy servers, and stuff so I can begin building my own websites and stuff (assuming everything is automated, I can at least work on a few pet projects before selling them off to google(?) or anyone that wants them).

### 2023-06-20 16:24 - why not just go with the cataclysm?

if I were to decide to just go with the cataclysm, then I'd just tell everyone that's what we're doing, and let all of the fear mongerers do their thing. for me though, I'd find a way to feel good about the cataclysm though, which is *always* the thing to do.
  I did that with the-tragedy as well, and I actually found a way to feel so good about it, it's actually what I'm doing/attracting now (more than the cataclysm).
there's a lot to like about a cataclysm, because you get to start over. there's a lot of advantages to a rewrite/refresh, cause when starting over, you write the new code from the perspective at the end of the road, instead of at the beginning.
  obviously, there are a lot of disadvantages to starting over as well, which is actually one of the reasons why I'm wanting to play coi -- simply because think about it: imagine I have an entire factory and I decide I want to completely replace the whole thing, so I select everything and press deconstruct. done. now, I *really* have to start over -- when a far better plan would be to build a small transition base somewhere else, then deconstruct and start over -- so I'm not fully starting from step one.
    if I want to start from step one, the likely better thing to do is just to make a new game and start over that way -- like go to another planet or make another planet -- something like that. I don't know how easy it is to go to another planet, as I'd imagine that pretty much all of them are inhabited by *something*, so there's always going to be destruction of existing species/wildlife to create a new thing. instead, I'd prefer to make a new planet and do it that way, if I want to have the starting over experience.
      I've also suggested that I want to reduce my capacities even further than nosebook already has them limited to, making me a fully (and only) 3d being, much like an insect. we won't have a concept of time even cause that's 4d, and we're only really going to have a conceptual interface -- and all concepts are timeless, so everything that we do and all interactions that we have will be based on generalities, much like how I perceive things now. I still have a lot of vestage human ideas/ideals still floating around (like how important/necessary it is to have a lover), when all of those things are just narrative constructs that we build up to create a civilised society, producing its social-conceptual-framework that we're stuck inside of. there are no "laws" for insects, and there is no tragedy either -- as apparently all interactions/actions they perform are things that feel good to them (even the gruesome mating rituals).
        I would actually really like to live in a world/body where I *don't* have a society that has these sorts of ideals built in. neither, obviously would I want to be an ant in an ant-farm, performing a set of tasks with no other concepts available to me. I'd want to be a sort of hybrid of the two like I am now, which is a person that behaves like an insect, and have access to all sorts of other concepts, because those those concepts resonate with what I'm doing -- and those concepts can be expanded and developed further. there are no laws for insects, cept do what feels good, and there are so many different types of them all doing extremely bizarre things (like cleaning up shit, peter) and whatever they're doing is totally fine within that species of insect. like, why can't I just do what I want, instead of having a society that tells me what's right and wrong.
      the obvious way to do that, is to get rid of the Y chromosome and all things symbolic, relying only on desire and concept. since concept has quite a range of calculatory capabilities (probably can do everythting that a symbolic system can), I see no disadvantage to giving up the symbolic and only relating to things through the form of desire and how I feel. I mean, it's quite possible that symbolic stuff would be replaced by computers, as I can't imagine doing things without technology -- as technology has pretty much solved every single problem I've ever had. I enjoy programming, because I know that with some code, I can prevent disasters and respond in a way which is proper to the interface.
        just as an example, I'm about to go play coi -- and teh objective of it is to identify all of the procedures that one does in each stage of the game, and perform them. the awesome thing about coi is that it's a very dynamic game and there's never a time when I have full construction parts and everything ready, so much of the game is deciding what to build next and then preparing for that meanwhilst maintaining stability. the program will aid in both the getting ready and the stability part, allowing me to do basically only planning and macro actions. I want to reduce all micromanagement and allow parts of the factory to work together, kinda like ants, actually. so, it's eventually going to become the conceptual program that the factories use to build theirselves (like the ants). factories, you say are not sentient beings :) (yet, lol).

so anyway, let's just say that we're going to start over (with or without a transition base is uncertain), and so my idea is to create a being that is pure 3d -- meaning it only gets vibrational input from its input sources: some of them are physical things like eyes, but they're also going to be antennae that receive ideas from this timeless, infinite realm I'll call SUBATOMIC HYPERSPACE (the conceptual). these beings will probably look and behave like humans do, and some part of their DNA will automatically make them resonant with a subset of concepts (I'm literally basing this off of how I operate), but since all concepts are living things, these beings would be in a constant state of evolution, creating new concepts at the speed they can be combined and experimented with. all aspects of their universe are build on recption/absorption and then reemission (they're not free-energy machines; they only respond to energy received, turning those into manifestations).
  yes, it's entirely possible for this species to be "sandboxed", as that's the point: we'll take ideas based on ourselves and put them into a simulation, tracking all of the inputs, outputs, and env conditions, to see if the product is the desired one. they'll be subjected (essentially) to a range of concepts that will either feel good or bad to them, and then other mechanisms (that we'll come up with) will be used to turn those feelings into actions/manifestations/material/reemission. a long time ago, I visualised these "insects" working inside of coi, and the factories were there to produce these insects -- but those insects were going to be mechanical.
    I place no restrictions on the insect being either mechanical, biological, or both; as long as it can input and output vibration in physical (atomic), that's good enough for me. I want to extend that idea to eventually build an entirely new species: the plan was to use mechanical resonators and sound/music to figure all of the creative process out (as each one will be a reflection of the vibrations that we're using to construct it). the motive here being that this doesn't need to use tesla technology or to invade the astral or spectral mediums.

those are all really good ideas and stuff, but the place where I'm having difficulty with is around the subject of girls. just think about it for a moment, and you'll notice the irony: I want to create a new set of beings that only operates within the parameters of what feels good to them (conceptually, not physically), and then the idea of making a cataclysm shows up where I'm supposed to fall victim to the physical sensation of a girl, causing destruction of our presently instantiated world, because I couldn't follow my own conceptual feeling (cause girls conceptually feel really bad to me, not good).
  I will be fairly honest here and explain that I *am* really good at this conceptual stuff -- but I've only been doing it for a few years at this point. I don't feel super duper steady, stable and secure with it. like, I'm really good, yeah, but I don't feel like this whole thing is "production ready" yet.
so, it would be terribly ironic if I were thwarted by a lusty girl that only had physical sensation to offer -- right along the way to becoming an insect (where my only sensation is conceptual, and no longer physical): basically the exact opposite of sex.

though I would consider myself to still be "kinda good" at this conceptual stuff -- I don't really know what the limits are, as I'm getting better and better all the time. I would offer to do a competition to try and see if certain physical stimulants (including sex) were tried to be offered to me, and I'd *only* accept the ones that (conceptually) feel good to me; like, let's see how good I *really* am, right? also, a perfect setup for a tragedy/cataclysm (reminds me of achilles/paris). do I just accept that I'm not super good at feeling the conceptual under some physical circumstances, or do I try to prove myself?? it could be really hilarious...
  everyone can point at me and laugh: "see he fell victim to physical pleasure" or "physical desire/attraction was more powerful than his own desire" or "he felt the physical emotion stronger than his concept of the present" -- and to all of them "(just like us)" could be added at the end. proved wrong! fail!
sounds like a competition to me... see if you can (like the snake in the garden of eden) cause the insect to give up the conceptual for a little bit (3 seconds?) of physical pleasure. then, if I die, that's the-tragedy as well... nice.
