### act-1: the unsolvable problem
scientists have discovered that females are designed to remain at a constant frequency, and because the two X chromosomes run at opposite frequencies, it's impossible to send a nothing signal to get both cromosomes to change simultaneously, so they're essentially without technical repair.
men are advancing/evolving really rapidly, yet tit seems that women are are not able to keep up with the Y-fueled expansion/menergy, still being stuck in an archaic  cultural-conceptual-framework, and adhering to the notion that society retain these antiquated concepts; a lot of the old [sumerian-drawbacks](/sumerian-drawbacks.md) (and other vestages) to continue to hang around. ----- so, in order for men to be able to reach their evolutionary dreams, they've got to find a way to evolve the females in a stable way.
  turns out that all attempts to try and change their perception ultimately result in massive clashes with the society/culture that she's in. they seem to transmit a sort of "reality frequency" (which comes from the canceled/self-destructed frequency between the XX) that's causing people around them to *see things the way they do*, and nobody likes that, cause so many beautiful/technical/mechanical things are misinterpretted or lableled as not important or even made to be *ugly* (including theirselves and people around them).

### act-2: the discovery
what scientists have done is to try and turn the pair into a triangle (or pyramid in 3d), where the two/four feet are expanded/moved simultanously, directed by the point/peak at the top. therefore, by directing  the expansion/contraction of the two, then the planet (top/bottom frequency dual) stays in an orbit that doesn't collide with other similar orbits (or non-orbited individuals).

### act-3: the realisation
turns out that pyramids are really good at modulating this self-destroyed frequency, so the frequency is capped off by a pyramid, and the main culprit for the modulation of the females' cultural is done by many of these ancient pyramaid structures -- and these revered and venerated structures are actually what's responsible for a lot of the local cultural behaviour of the females.
  also, venus affects both DNA and the planet, and other planets have different effects, so because these are largely unchangeable (out of our technical capacity to change), then we have to take matters into our own hands.

one of the main culprits is the great pyramid. everyone loves it and wants it to stay around: a symbol of human evolution, and our genetic heritage -- however, the option has to be considered, to dismantle the great pyramid (and finally see what's inside, right?)

the other major concern is the realisation that humans will want to build their own pyramid setup to control their evolution; what will happen? will tragedy strike as big-tech/pharma/data/whatever try and control the system, instead of evolving the females, but actually put all X's in a newly constructed localised cultural matrix? what would happen?

### act-3: the implementation
scientists have discovered that they can alter the frequency (somehow, hand wavey quantum technology) and have decided to control all of humankind be morulating (for us) how we see the world: in some places, some pepole are especially greedy, and so greedy people kinda congregate there (like las vegas, for example). planetary life is organised into a set of 20 nodes that become the centre of a very large city: a sort of omenous mecha that presides over that region, pumping out the (conceptual) frequecy of that area's culture (controlled byw those implementing it, to be certain)

### act-3: the techno-saviour
some hotshot decides that he/she is going to solve the problem technologically (prolly something quantum) and then a silly "silicon valley" startup of a very diverse set of people seemingly "save the world". it could also be very musical, and music (and the sounds it creates) resonates inside of the body in a way that gets everyone down to the dance floor, evolving the night away.
