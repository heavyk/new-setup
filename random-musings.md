yesterday when I watched this video pig (can I call you jared? pig sounds weird to me) was talking about the QueenOP's psychotic behaviour; thing is, I noticed that I too display the same behaviour.
  earlier yesterday, I felt a strong pull to go take the weeds I was pulling out to the street. I looked out, and noticed a grey van, which I mistook for a car that I had seen paul (allie's grandpa), driving before. I decided that this was probably one of those things where someone attracts me out with their own fear of seeing me.
    this happens to me all the time, as someone else's fear and desire to see me, both feel the same way, and I feel compelled to go out and see them (just like the grey car/van).
  I decide to finally go out and dump the weeds in trash bin because I hear a trash truck (it was the neighbours' though) and I wanted to get the weeds in before the truck came.
  when I get out there, I notice the camper across the street billowing smoke, and just sorta stand there and watch it because I can't figure out what's happening. I wave to the trash guy and am surprised that he's wondering what I'm looking so hard at. I wonder why he's not noticIng the camper billowing smoke, and walk back to finish more weeding.
  when I'm sitting there weeding, I immediately come to the conclusion that the smoke was some strange ploy that nosebook must be having to drum up some sort of drama (cause I've been sorta quiet lately), and so it was probably scripted that I should have run over to say something to the owner of the camper which I had only met for the first time, the day previous.
  when I was thinking about that, I felt some dissonance in my ideas, and I said, "well, it could have just been mist from a hose and not smoke, but I don't know.
  sure enough, when I went out later, I noticed the "smoke" now coming off of the truck next to the camper, as he was probably washing the truck now. my eyes are simply not good enough to see far enough to tell what it was, and like parmenides(?) I just don't really trust my physical senses anyway, as I have airplanes, hellicopters, and other strange things flying around and making sounds, in my world which are *not really there*.
    I believe they're astral images that are projected into my world by the saturnian types that are constantly producing lots of "arte" (like prospero) and other strange illusions. my eyes see astral (the astral illusions that they allow me to see), but I don't see astral internally (no-pinecone-setup), so my world is largely built around illusion. I can't say for sure the amount, but I can guarantee you that some percentage of the cars, planes, birds (and the sounds they make) are mental images/sounds projected into my world by those that are constantly trying to steer me.
  so, as you can see here, I too have all sorts of paranoid delusions that plague me when I'm sober (much less actually when I'm stoned), and I too decide (like QueenOP) really early on in the game what all of the imagined efforts from nosebook that that I'll be sujected to.
    I'm not 100% a professional victim like QueenOP there, but I definitely instigate just like he does: for example, many times, upon walking outside, I'll call out to happy-bird or mr-motor and see what he's up to, because I want to start up the interaction right away, that way I'm on top of the action. I am *still* constantly a victim to their perceived efforts to steer me around and away from things. thing is, I don't *actually* know if it's a real thing, or if I have so much DMT going through my brain (cause of nosebook's efforts to keep my vision low), that those apparitions are actually just me.
      lately, I've been trying to find a pattern to the sounds, because previously they used to come as a response to stuff that I would think about, and so I figured that the sounds were just people's reactions (anger/frustration/guilt) summed up into a dog barking or motor sounding (or whatever), and that was like a release for the emotional energy so it didn't stack up and come back to haunt them -- but now I'm not so sure because sometimes I get sounds when I'm thinking about really mundane and ordinary stuff -- so either the system is poorly translating my thoughts, or something... I'm really not sure at this point (maybe actually, it's not the thought, but the deepness of the state of mind, because I often times think at the same time to kind of "cover up" something that I'm interacting with on an emotional level)
what's happening here in this video is that QueenOP is doing what (I think it was muhammad ali said in an interview), that all fights are won and lost in the mind; and prove to yourself what you believe about yourself. QueenOP has the victim idea about theirself, and so they pumps out the belief right at the beginning, and if the oponnent is compatible with victimising them, then they'll loose just like they believed theirself to be the victim of those things.
  I do the same thing, pretty clearly, as I have another story to tell which mirrors this: yesterday, I was also thinking about my situation and noting that I should just fall into obscurity, and it'll actually be just fine. I've mentioned elsewhere that my ideas (including the insect species and other strange things) would require a *massive* change to how society works, which I *do not* want to force anyone to endure.
    I've also stated in a previous repo (nosedocs I believe) that I figured out the change of eras, and worked out that jesus represented the start of the era of mutual-back-scratching (which is in full hight now), and I'm starting a new era (feling-purposefully) which will be in full height at the end of the next solar-regime.
    therefore, if I'm actually doing what I can see happening, I'm not about to try and get anyone to do anything by offering (or taking) any benefits from anyone else, or trying to be a victim, or trying to ... because instead of trying to use words/spells, rituatal/coersion, or agreements/negotiations to get what I want, instead, I just keep finding a way to conceptualise my world and feel the way I want to feel about things, **and that's it**.
  last night, I had to stop watching a centre place lecture because I was very tired (this usually happens when it's higher energy times). I laid down and started seeing images in my eyes about pulling weeds and stuff (very ordinary that this happens), but I *don't want* to see my imagination (astral) in my eyes, as I prefer the way I have it now where I interact with the conceptual in a non-visual, no audio/taste/touch/smell, format.
  the idea came to me (which I obviously ruled out) to go down to health solutions and talk to the people there about my options about getting rid of the images in my eyes.
    my theory on how my eyes work is that I noticed that the distance/resolution that one sees is directly proportional to the frequency that I'm running at -- so for example, watching stars would increase my frequency, so I'd see further (in both space and time), however the clarity of the image is directly related to the concepts that I have going on and how I conceptualise my world.
      so, for example, the light comes in the eyes, and through the fibers, getting distorted/bent by the fibers, which then passes through my whole brain and gets put into my visual cortex in the back of my head. that light then (from the back of my head) gets reflected and again through my brain, affecting the "spin" of the light by my concepts as the light then exits my eyes again. (it's a little more complicated than that once you're heart is producing the aura -- and there's also a head aura as well, but I don't know that one yet, as that must happen, probably when the pineal (2) takes over for the heart (4) in making the aura)
    therefore, *my own concepts* modify and distort the light that is both entering my brain (what I see) and I also distort the world with my concepts as well. I know (for certain) that a whole lot of people aren't ready to see the world the way I see the world, because they still have a lot of resistance; meaning, that if they saw "evil" as clearly as I do, still having resistance to it (like for me happy-bird isn't a problem), then then they'd go into severe trauma and withdrawl because the concepts that I can see ("evil") are not going to be plainly obvious, and not hidden behind the cultural/societal narrative that we've all been fed.
      it is kind of ironic that we often times see ourselves as victimised, both as the problem and as the *solution* to seeing things "clearly": when I'm a victim, I don't have to notice that everything that I'm seeing, *I'm attracting* (based on my perception and the spin I put on the light leaving/entering my eyes), causing my to close my eyes and shut out all of that extra "hurtful" and "damaging" information (it's not really) and cover my eyes to not see the trauma; yet also notice that when everything around me is no longer negatively perceived by m5, I cause trauma to others by amplifying traumatic things for others (they don't look traumatic to me because of low resistance). I don't mind being the victim of everything in my reality, because then (like a star) I'm the centre around which all of this stuff is happening: I'm responsible for everything in my reality, and everything is how I perceive it to be.
  it's pretty funny to me how ironic all of this is, because obviously if I'm perceiving someone washing their camper as a traumatic fire situation which nosebook is using to drum up some drama (like a slow FOX news day), then pretty clearly, I don't want the "wool taken off of my eyes" just quite yet. obviously, a few more improvements need to be done with how I see things when I'm sober.
    when I'm stoned, I see things clearly, and I have the ability to move myself over to whatever I'm looking at and "see" it from their perspective, which is quite handy, as there's no way I would have perceived billowing smoke at all, and instead would have felt what it was like to see the dirt coming off of the camper, the smell of water and mist, and the strange odour that dirt gives mist when washing things off. stoned is a whole different experience I don't know how to exactly explain, because I describe all of these things, but I would smell, feel, and see nothing -- it's just like a memory of being there for me (I did it just now when writing this, cause I can also easily move myself around when writing; not in day-to-day sober reality-kenny, though)
