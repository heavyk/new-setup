### 2023-09-24 03:48 - prophet abram/abraham thoughts

I opened up [a video on the prophet abraham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYbFXbfoE7E&lc=UgylyMtWdxj7mf8e97l4AaABAg), and I saw a comment there that read:

```
Prophet Abraham is non othan Hindu legend Ram.
Their myths is parallely similar.
Prophet Moses is non othan than Hindu Legend Krishna.
Their myths is parallely similar.
Judea tribe of originally Jahdava
Tribe(Tribe of Krishna)
```

that got me thinking about things -- because I've heard that before, and when I heard it, it resonated with me, yet I know also that the origin of the those that settled in the levant area (descendents of abraham) were also likely the same as a lot of the sea-peoples -- and as essentially egypt deflected their attack, they continued up the coastline and conquered the caananite/phonecian people up there, and sorta got sucked into that culture (they married the women and interbred with them -- which also harkens back to the atlantis (plato's version), and also the aryan superrace stuff that the germans were looking for). essentially, as the septuigent was likely their origin narrative, the they were likely greek people, who though intermixing with the mortal admixture of the local caananite women, they lost their god-like capabilites...
  the thing is here is that these stories don't combine -- right? how can abraham be the patriarch of both the indian peoples and also the aryan super-race? doesn't make sense.
what happened is, when I looked at the above comment, I thought to myself there may be a way that both of these stories are true, as there may be something (kinda like a concept) that manifests differently in different timelines (and/or locations) in 3d space. my theory actually solves this problem entirely because I claim that these different 3d honeypots were put down all over the planet. some were caananite, some were indian, others russian, germanic, etc. (all of them).
  you have to imagine this equation from the perspective of desire, which is the 3d manifestation of YHWH: there are all these guys in astral, that are not a whole lot more intelligent than primitive humans; bigfoots, if you will. they had someone (krishna, moses, etc), and each one of these bigfoot all perceive him (YHWH's son -- moses, krishna, mars, etc.) in the way that their mental apparatus was capable of perceiving. to one bigfoot (a reflection of their own mentality) teaches them how to get their greatest desire in whatever way is their latest thinking. some of the enkidu see him as showing how how to be a warrior, others how to get the girl he wants, whatever... he's just teaching them all how to get their desire, and he appears to each of them individually as a reflection *of their perception*.
    in a more technical look at it, YHWH is a reflection of *all* of human desire, which is why he's translated differently in everyone's perception, because they all see what they desire -- and so YHWH would be a really sexy female to some, and a golden ass to still others, and --- it gets pretty crazy what some people desire -- and the more diversity, the better. YHWH loves that there are more (taboo) ways to desire something, because (monad)/she/he/it, is always a reflection of *everything* -- so like pure-evil and also pure-desire all at the same time -- and there's always some one out there that has that pure-evil bit, or any other, so pure-desire/pure-evil could be anything to anyone. get (monad) around one person that is terrible, and (monad) is capable of being really terrible. get them around someone really good, and (monad) is capable of being really good. therefore, conditions and a deep understanding of desire must be accomplished for the (sun)/(son)/adam/mars/etc. which is a reflection of (monad) in the physical. the sun is a reflection of the (monad), just like the (sun) is a relection of the (monad). therefore, sun/adam/mars will always be whoever/whatever anyone wants sun/mars to be. (monad) can be anything to anyone, and so can sun.
  what then happens is eventually these bigfoot spy out some of these honey-pots that have been put down on earth. these are fully autonomous (as in they're symbolically programmed) XX tribes that essentially reflect the earth, a 3d entity. these bigfoot come and find these tribes, and some join the tribe and teach them things (these are the shamen), and their physical 3d bodies gain some awareness of a different world through the administration of psychedellics, but it's my contention that these were likely all XX, including the men. when interbreeding with the XX, the YY bigfeet lost their godlike caabilities (ie, full astral perception) anymore, as they suddenly became aware of the physical aspect -- something that nobody had ever really considered: what do *they* think they look like? bigfoot never sees anyone for how they *are*, but only as how their own brain interprets them visually/physically/etc. everything they see is all *what they want to see*.
    from the perspectivve of desire, it's perfectly logical that these physicality honeytraps would exist, because desire is a reflection from physical, and so the only way to experience pure-desire is from the perspective of physical. therefore, desire wants to manifest itself into these bigfoot's reality, but their own mind is preventing them from seeing things for *how they are*, instead of *how I want them to be* or *how they *should* be*.
    therefore, "if you *really* want to get what you want, you gatta come to to 3d". and so their own mind created these honey-traps that these guys wanted to have -- and so in order to get ready to jump into physical, they invoke this mars/gilgamesh/etc figure (which is the quality of their imagination), going to tell them how to get these symbolically-oriented (sorta like narrative installations).
      what I mean is, imagine that somehow I had come up with the most awesome woman -- or liet's say that I know her, and she's not just some figment of my imagination, --- and I introduce to her to someone and tell her -- this is how you get her (this is how you conquer them and take over their women and girls) *this* is the "right" way to do it (which is a reflection of their own concepts) and so for some people he presents a war as an idea, or maybe a social network -- or whatever (those are examples in this case) because I think we're all this adam guy at heart -- the original XX male, but we've built up symbolic resistance to some ideas which prevents us from reflecting (monad)/YHWH, simply because symboically we prevent ourselves from it -- and rightfully so, because around some truly awful people, I can be pretty awful. in fact, now that I think about it, it's very possible that adam/mars/sun is "I" -- as in I who is talking, the physical identity.
        there's a lot of truth to that because I notice (for me at least), that my imatination is always "you", but my conceptual and physical is "I". when I experience a concept, it is *now*, and it is *I*. even if I feel an "inanimate" object (there is no such thing) suchass a rock, then I am inside the rock when I feel it. I am as if I were the rock in whatever position/circumstance I put him in, in space and tim5.
      then, what I did is I said -- here's the way to find yourseelf everything you ever wanted -- you know like the guys that would get them to do favours for them in exchange for whatever they wanted -- and I really had a way. I would be like mars/adam then -- however, I want to note that anyone can be this way, as we all are (having at least one X), and it's only our own concepts (ie, how we perceive reality) which prevents us from seeing it that way.
        anyway, this one is actually funny, because I *actually do* have a way, but it's not really the "easy way" either. quite frankly, nobody wants it, because I don't give it a lot of hype. the way you get everything you want, is to just be authentic. there is no rulebook -- as I've found by watching humans, is that everyone is capable of putting up with stuff, if the person has some authenticity to them (which is clarity of "what I want"), then that person's "spunkiness" (yes, let's go with that word), is perectly tolerable.
        I have such a proposterous idea which is completely the opposite of mars/adam though, because I aim to make it possbile (through the aid of technology (what could go wrong)) for everyone to essentially *perfect* theirselves, because that is what I want to do, and I want to also make it aavailable to everyone -- as a full "go at your own pace" sort of system, cause trust me !!! --- I do not want to go fast. I like smoothe, and for me that means taking my improvement at a leisurly speed. I'm already going fast enough, there's just simply no reason to want to go any faster, lol. so the technology is everythting I would want for myself, being this adamic type myself. I wanna go to physical with the most awesome 3d setup, cause I think (personal opinion here), that physical is quite nice. I like seening things how *they* want to appear, instead of only seeing a reflection of myself in everyone I see. (see what I mean). I have two points of view. one point of view is my astral Y perception, which is "what *I* want to see", and the other is "how they appear to theirself". I'm not sure exactly what I seee, but it's a blend of both.
          like, when I see someone, I see them how they see theirself, but it's also mixed in with how I want to see them -- which I can't see, so I instead see it in their physical body's animation and (stragely) appearance.
            quick theory on that one, because I think I actually *improve* (or unimprove) people's appearances when they're around me, because I tend to see everyone quite optimistically, and it's because every way that someone sees theirself, is also how they *feel* about theirself, and for me (cause I've lowered a lot of resistance), many of the ways that others feel about theirselves, I don't feel it as a problem at all, because I know that feeling. I started out with the most embarraassing and started my way up in life -- so I've come to be OK with myself in just about any situation -- it just takes a moment of adjustment before I can no longer reject a situation. I'm a relatively fast learner, and eventually (as I move toward perfection), I will (*]over time[*) learn to be able to feel no resistance to (and possibly fullly absorb) *everything*; that's the goal anyway (but at a leisurely pace -- no rush bro -- no getting hasty). (brb)
