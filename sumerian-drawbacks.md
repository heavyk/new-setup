gain is something that is purchased for *money*, and so we can get *money* from the farmer *one time*, or every year. obviously we want that residual income, so let's make them "annuals" instead of "parennials".
  the base of the concept is to get a reoccuring (frequential) income, over a one-time income, so a frequency has an up and a down, and so a society that does not believe in reincarnation, has to have all of the "good" plants as growing, living, servingg their purpose, then finally dying, for the nourishment/pleasure of humans.
    therefore, it's portant to know that the "down" part of the waveform is perceived in the context of that culture: in that case, it's those "good" plants, but in today's society, it's when it breaks/dies/(falls apart) (so we need to replace them)
      we view the down phase as broken/destruction/death, and not as a replacement part (like the keys in a printing press, or an actor for a script)
      likewise we view the "up" phase in similar manner: is the "up" the crop growing up to exact height/weight/volume structural specifications, or is it an "improvement" on the previous model; and if so, what *kind* of improvement: performance or character ("right way" vs *faster* way).
