### 2023-10-10 00:30 - first message

hi, I thought to message you ever single myth-vision video that I saw, but I don't really know what I want to say. so, I'm just going to write. I'll start off with an explanation of my version of "history" (and how time works), and then follow it up with some thoughts on "who wrote the gospels".

I could never be a classical "historian" in the traditional sense, simply because I believe that every timeline which arrives to the present to be a valid one. most of "history" has been a fight over which narrative is the "right" one -- and anyone who doesn't believe the same way as we (some culture group with an origin story) do, should be exterminated, so that the whole entire planet can live in harmony, and believe the same thing. as such, we try to get everyone on earth "on the same page", and so the various narratives that exist are an effort to try and bring every human being on earth into the same global imagination of how the "past" was.
	to understand what I mean by this, let us imagine an imaginary or astral earth, which is not at all unlike how our own builds a world-view of something: a global concept of how everything fits together. multiple world-views exist on this planet, and there are as many of them as there are conscious human beings. we might imagine each one of these world-views as a sort of point (of light, like a star) in a sort of cloud: some world-views are closer to others than others -- and so you may have millions in the islam grouping, and a bunch in the big christian grouping, but upon looking closer, there are a number of different minor groupings as well corresponding to different denominations, orthodox, and minor sects, all the way down to small groupings of cults and things like that.
	each one of these world-views has a different version of how "history" is formed, with nobody having a complete picture of it all. some historians and academics align themselves more to one grouping of world-views than another, but it must be understood that all of these groups have massive "blind spots" where aspects have not been considered or cannot be known with our present level of technology
		which, I do believe that time machines do exist, however a time traveler can go to *any time* (even one that academics would call a ficticious one) -- as long as the tim5 corresponds with the rest of the beliefs in the travelers' world-views: so like gravity has to work, and the sun has to be there and, precipitation cycle is pretty much the same; all the important stuff. as such, time machines are not actually used to explore the "past" -- because *anything* is possible, but instead used to adjust our trajectory into the future (which is just a (symbolic) world-view grouping extrapolated into the future) -- because everyone experiencing that alternate past *believes* it, and so when they return to the "present" (they never left the present), they *believe* that to be the past, and so their world-view has been updated to reflect that, which then through intercourse of ideas, other world-views get updated as well. (I say "updated" but all of these points are in motion, again, a lot like stars)
  therefore, I'm not going to try and conclusively sell you or anyone else on any form of history (in science terms, I'm saying I don't offer a comprehensive 4d schema/trajectory; instead, I offer the 5d perspective).

now, when I suggest the ideas in the following bits about "who wrote the gospels", consider that I'm drawing a lot off of a [centre-place lecture of the same name](https://youtu.be/BT12rsfvnhI) which I watched last night, and today youtube suggested me to watch [your myth-vision video](https://youtu.be/uINo-f7xG9g) of the same title, as well about an hour ago. I also want to be clear that this idea came to me only last night after watching that video.
essentially the idea goes to me like this: mark sounds like a guy like me that's writing. I often times misquote things because I've stored the concept in my brain of what the text says in that section, and so when I retrieve it, I translate the concept back into english or spanish (are my only two options right now). I can also turn the idea into flow-charts and timelines too, so it doesn't have to only natural language as its output. I often times translate words and ideas into mental art and pictures (which I don't "see" with my eyes -- but they exist internally -- much like the world-views)
  in fact there's a lot of similarity between the world-views perspective to history and what I call "conceptual perception", as one of my concepts (which is all a world-view really is) can easily be compared with another concept, and bigger concepts -- and some more abstract, sorta like how I can "feel" (or things "sound") to me like a thing/narrative I heard somewhere else. I can compare my concepts/world-views to others concepts/world-views with ease (though none of them have names -- just feelings) and the result is a feeling (which I experience as a giant picture) of how the world works. in fact, I am doing that right this very moment while writing to you, as I look at the same thing/concept/world-view from a slightly different angle and write another sentence. I've learned enough knowledge and paid enough attention to how to formulate sentences, and each sentence formulation has a "feel" to it. some sentences feel or "sound" better than others. (shakespere is a study into how to make certain ideas "sound" really awesome, so he too has the ability to feel how a sentence "sounds" (not with ears)).
as I was watching the centre-place lecture the author of mark sounded vvery roman to me. in fact, he sounded to me like being specifically from the flavain dynasty. the idea that came to me is that this gospel was probably written in 69 as a sort of self-prophesying *proof* that such a thing would happen -- because it was either be someone that titus hired to write, or titus himself that wrote it. I believe the latter, and I'll take the next section to "prove" it before moving on to the other three.
  I must noww introduce the concept of the triad, and this is an extremely noticeable triad in most all of modern literatere. the three players are mars, vulcan, and venus/aphrodite. the woman is the most interesting, because she is earth; a shapeshifter taking on the form of (almost?) every human being on the planet. she is gaia, the shapeshifter, the puma, the black condor, owl, dove, venus, aphrodite,... I personally find her the most remarkable of them because of her role as ishtar/inana in the sumerian civilisation (who were mostly a bunch of vulcan/enkidu and mars types + (prostitutes?)). in the book of revelation, she's "the great whore", but she's the same inana that descends into the underworld.
    OK, I really need to pause a moment and go over some sumerian mythology: the first world-view -- until a bunch of try-hards tried to turn it into what they think it should be: us, the aryans :) well, OK, I'm trying to be too salacious here...
    inana/aphrodite is who I will call earth which I'll call "7th ray or physical perception"; and that's where the star on the inside of the earth's spherical resonator slows down pretty rapidly (our atmosphere is only a few hundred km tall) to zero, and then inverts itself (very much like the skull of the head -- notice the iconography). there is an inner earth just like there is an inner skull, where our imagination resides (where these world-views/concepts get manifest into visual/imaginary/astral). the planet is the same, also having an outer-skull area where everything else *outside* of "self" is *percieved*, and all of the inner-skull stuff is *real* (or is it the other way around?).
    mars is the masculine version of that. our bodies are receptive beings: we receive all sorts of signals which then a bunch gets filtered out and transformed into a physical/visceral (happening in the body) sensation. mars has a narrative big-picture of how all of those signals/symbols fit together; an internal world-view. I equate the this narrative structure to the Y chromosome.
    vulcan well, remember how our bodies are receptive beings? each of those receptions have a mental representation as well as physical; so, just as each neuron has a whatever vultage in relation to another, so too do these relations exist with the world-view of the person on the mental plane (the one that astral/imaginary is made of). so he's exactly like mars in that he has a symbolic representation of something encoded within a matrix of relations between concepts/ideas/world-views. I also equate him with the Y chromosome.
    those three characters (mars|aphrodite|vulcan) exist in essentially every mythology available to us in cOncept.
    for the sumerians, this was gilgamesh (mars), enkidu (vulcan), the prostitute (brb 03:12)

    (if I may interject a moment here a brief commentary on what it's like publishing my thoughts so regularly: every publish causes a complete abortion of the idea/concept for me, and when I go back to the idea I once had (before publish) is actually gone; I can't access it anymore. it's changed so much that it's unrecognisable to me; but then, I just learn a new way to see the idea before I published it. for most people, the abortion of an idea like that is often devastating, and for mee it was a lot as well. I eventually got pretty good at finding the new concept, because it's pretty easy: the better version of the concept feels better than the previous one. I sort of do all of this on purpose, because it shows that my concepts are constantly updating, even if the text on it dates itself pretty quickly. what I then do, is I simply repeat/relate the same concepts in newer more complex ways all of the time. the mental expansion that I receive from doing it is insane. many podcasters and the like know that mental expansxionn happens prretty rapidly, once I start telling my thoughts out loud (or trying to render them as best/clear as possible), what ends up happening is that because I'm constantly updating the text of the concept, to kind of render the concept in a more expansive way)
    (if I may continue, as we'll soon see, further down in the thesis, I need to find a technology or some capacity to allow others to esssentially "undo" my teachings on the idea, and learn it their own way. this is essentially the technology that is desired, which is that for novelty to turn into diversity (until more novelty is desired). I'll explain more later -- however what's (I think is) really happening here is that my conceptual world is growing at a magnificent rate, and more and more things will depend on me, and treat me like they treat earth: exploit my body. it's normal right? for me it is, and so that kinda makes me the universe (ie, soemone who lives forever, because of such monumental desire for my existence for longer than a single lifetime can imagine: the product of a corporation -- something that lives for a long time, and strongly depends on me). you know, as I was thinking earlier, one of the cool things I'd like to do is to make it possible for everyone to be able to (once/as we all become weightless) reduce different conceptual resistances (conceptual changes to their form), so for example they could "upgrade" their patience to a higher level (the details are kinda gorey, which is that I don't know technolgically how anyone could do it the "easy" way, but I'm sure some will figure it out -- I just make a desire which is like a really complex high-frequency vibration -- I dunno, with how I feel or perhaps "know" it could feel (like) -- and anyway that complex wave attracts the desired signal -- so my rememberance/memory of that desire is always in the old (recognised) form, so I just have to find the better feeling concept/recognition of the old form --- so I go bouncing higher and higher all the time, cause I like to :) and it's fun.) anyway, where was I? OH YES)

  before I continue, I just want to say that this is *my* (very not final version) of sumerian mythology, from which I've based this "understanding" that I have of it. I don't really have any thing to say what I've got is the *final* answer in any way. what I have is a working intuition of how things are. the main property of 3d earth, is that everything is constantly in a flux of change. I model my work on that concept, that everything I write, and I'd admit that it's going per- word/concept where it suddenly gets "outdated" on me. often times as a pastime, I go in to check in on some of these concepts, after they've been reacted to; because, here's the deal: I think I have the best most comprehensive world-view out there at the moment, but there's no stopping anyone else from having the same realisation. that's the moment of enlightenment: it's OK to be different/better/awesomemore than evveryone else. + want to display that it's possible to manipulate the conceptual world with one's perception of an idea. the perception is really a 2nd ray (relational) thing that exists not only in the conceptual, but also in the physical brain. the combination of these two signals is very high frequency, so it's basically invisible. I'm fairly certain that I get mine hijacked all the time, and I don't know if it's my own code/cconcepts that are making these things appear or not (I'm a pretty creative person) so it's likely my (I would suppose) own doing. nevermind that. the result is I'm constantling having to find a higher and higher frequency (ie, lower and lower resistance) which is the definition of desire pretty much; that attribute alone, convinces me that I/kenny have lowered my resistance to enough concepts that I've become quite flexible in space and time. everyone can do it. I claim that we all have the earth in us, and we're literally the only ones that are holding us back from that spanning space and perception because of our own resistance: I have to be this to this person; that to another person; this way at church, and that way at school. (sorry to get preachy. I think I was channeling you a bit there. anyway) and so what we end up here is everyone fitting into that conceptual percception through symbol and myth. symbol and myth are all the building blocks that one needs to create an artificial reality. each of these symbolic structures eventually breaks because it's no longer useful -- or rather I should say no longer desired. desire is constantly going higher and higher frequency, and so it's never able to stop. the only place that desire can manifest is into a fully *3d* body. not 4d or 5d or 11d or whatever: the bare minimums, and one of the things I want to do is to make a matte black version of ourselves, but because concept is a frequency, carbon (the stuff our body is made out of) can illuminate and swirl around, all with the power of what I call "conceptual programs". I have a lot of them, and a lot are available, and a lot are a secret (that not even I know about), but that doesn't matter, because I can only access the highest frequency ones (ie, desire -- which is a physical concept), so really only 3d (which is constantly changing), is a perfectly suitable place for something like desire. anyone who wants to follow me on that one, go for it (just desire it), right -- but I want to say it's kind of annoying constantly having to rediscover concepts all the time. it results in kinda bad memory (if the memory didn''t feel good) and a sort of forgetfulness/loftiness that will make you a little more childlike. it's really terrible, let me tell you. but anyway... that's the message. the medium is the message, but so is that one, from a higher perspective: don't desire the medium to give you what you want, instead I just desire that my own concepts are constantly outdated. they continue to update at like a really rapid rate, because I destroy even my best ideas intentionally. I hold on to no idea as something only I can experience; which is essentially what universal-perception is really all about. ... wow, that went a little too much salesman on that one; that's the problem with the medium: it informs the message/world-view. I sincerely hope that my unfortunate accident of selling an idea such as desire will be revered as anything but deplorable. I really do wish to provide a way for anyone to learn it for theirselves. (see what I mean? desire.)
  long intro. what the hell was I talking about? lol. right, the sumerians. this one gets nuts, so brace yourself.
  The sumerians talk about this past/future time of this world where it was organised differently where thoth is in 1st position (so he takes over for me) and then a weird set of 6 other beings following him, oops. I wrote it backwards; thoth is in 7th position when saturn-the-planet was in power. it talks about time when inana (in 1st position) was on top, but then she descended into the nether world right, and the planets are all way different than they are now, because jupiter destroyed the 5th planet, tiamtat right -- and so when that happened, planets past mars all fell down a slot energetically (they're probably in a more constrained position now, actually) and that caused thoth/mercury/paris to be thrown out of 3d: the fall of troy. now inana runs the show, and the whole planet is now "infested" with her genetics. she's queen of desire, and also every woman, and man but the difference is that men have a narative component to our genetics that describes what's wanted in symbolic form. I believe there's a replica copy of it inside of our brains, much like the one in middle of the solar system: issis. anyway that symbolic representation of desire is our primary source of attraction, until desire/attraction is experienced directly, which happens because both are working simultaneously (the symbolic and the desire; it's a medium I call relational, and the less symbolic representation they have, the more conceptual it is. the symbolic/narrative is the veil that one has to pierce through to be able to see the concept for what it *really* is: pure-desire.). anyway, that's earth, and we're all a part of it. it's an organism that lives forever. like all other planets (though they hide it with a shell) and stars out there, all live forever. science (thinking that stars are only finite), I must say is a direct reflection of our inability to be able to conceptualise something that can live *forever*.
  it's a crazy thing, but essentially what happens is that earth basically takes over, and so now a constantly growing number of things are becoming relative to the earth in more ways than just position (which is just a small part of the spectrum), and so that's when even the sun bows to inana/earth and everything now revolves around this ultra self-serving woman. the people around her perceived her, and she grew into bigger and bigger form until she caused an inversion, where the inside became so loud inside of itself, it popped (like ann egg) and the inside became the outside. we live on top of the centre of the universe -- and so what I believe is that myth is talking about how we/different people eventually perecieved someone that thinks they're the centre of the universe. total societal collapse. enter the aryans red (btw the sumerians were the aryans black, like hitler) and now we're all (or at least should be by now) children of desire, which means that we are also connected to that constantly increasing signal called desire. it causes all things to grow (and our resistance/dependence causes it to slow/stop) and it's in all things. it's that life essence, and I'd kinda like to imagine that the furthest we've gone down the rabbit hole is into what I'm calling the conceptual. it's fully possible to build a new interpretter for higher and higher frequencies. we are receptive beings, so why now just add on more wavelengths? why not cusxtomise it.
    it's a really tragic story though for any stone age culture, because they didn't notice anything different, but eventually desire is making those cultrus ssystems more and more obsolete to keep up with the new harmonics, and it turned into complete outrage and awfulness if that's what one was experincing, or the manifestation/realisation of one's greatestt/desire *or fear* (and usually both in the same body). all things collapsed because we essentially lived on the inside of the earth/egg and that is like the imagination. that imagination travels toward the inner sun, which means that originally we were built all as a reflection of the universe, and then when inana descended, then she essentially kicked thoth out of physical and became the new 3d. we essentially fell out of our symbolic inner-skull imagination and into the harsh 3d outer-skull reality that we're all "cast out" of the inner earth's glorious realms.
      the way that I imagine tmat it would be is after passing the inverse, from then on, you're going into more and more dense plasma as one approachs the inner core, which is basically like super duper ultra dense hydrogen. the blackest of black. however, we humans don't see the hydrogen, instead we see the imagination of that "time" (world-view). I don't have a pinecone, so I see 3d reality. that was necessary to get me into this weightless state of desire. I believe it's going to be possible to be impure-desire (that is, contaminated by the imagination), and we'll call those ones insects. I perfer however to be a plant. I don't care for the pinecone, and prefer to see things the way I want to see them (like a plant). I'm just another antennae/hair/plant on the surface of the earth, just like most everyone else. I probably live in the inner world of the earth, where there's a pretty good simulation of what's going on the surface. anyway, what I think is happening is that we're going to eventually POP, and the sides will flip. you all will enter into the underworld (where I'm at now), and I'll go into the outer. the universe is ours/mine for the taking. some people will interpret that all sorts of different ways and do all sorts of things, but I don't care, cause I'll prolly chill on earth for the rest of my life. there's so much crazy cool stuff here that it's not really much necessary (yet) for me to want to see other places yet (like who knows -- maybe a trip to mars for a day would be fun -- cause it prolly looks a whole lot like pueblo co (where I live on "earth")). anyway, I have no idea where I live, as that seems to be quite the coverup in my day and age, but I don't really have so much worry, because desire is always finding an improvement. only something like desire could live forever, until of course she gets bored and wants to do something else, duh. [break time, brb]

### 2023-10-10 16:21 - the second

hi robyn,
I thoroughly enjoyed writing parts of the last letter (some more than others). I do have to admit that it was a dramatic failure, as I'm sure this one, will be as well. that aside, I want to talk about some of the characters in an abstract form.
  mars exists because vulcan wants him to be there; he's a product of desire, and so therefore he can be seen as the masculine form of anatau (anu) in human flesh. he existed back in the time of the sumerians, and since then as well.
  the way the human body is formed (out of physical matter), we have a sort of "hardware" (physical) brain and a "software" (conceptual) brain. both exist simultanously, and though the hardware version can be boosted/diminished in its operation, the fact remains: adam/mars is only as good as the hardware brain allows him to be. it's a limiting form to remain in physical, because without it, the brain would be the size of the universe. so, to ensure it's only a discreet part of the universal mind in one physical brain place, then we have the soft-soft-ware (some of you know what I'm talking about) which is all of the symbolic ideas that our society is built up upon.
    you know there's this really hilarious play about it, where dumuzi is telling his wife this extremely symbolically graphic dream he had about losing his penis and dying. so his wife, ereshkigal is so well versed in all of the proper syntax of behaviour established in the culture, she says, "OH NO, I'll go and tell everyone that you're going to lose your penis and die, and so anticipating his imenent death, she goes to mourn for him (cause that's what you're supposed to do). for her, it's very logical.
    however, for dumuzi, the symbolic aspect of the dream are terribly ominious (that's a mouthful). he's really quite upset, especially because when he asked her what she thought of it, she made it WAY WORSE (lol). anyway, so this is the guy and gal that have been put in charge of the earth. they're like tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumm, because they are only apable of seeing the symbolic aspect of reality, and so venus/ereshkigal (-3) can only see the pure symbolic system of how humans are supposed to interact. this kind of stuff was programmed by thoth into our DNA/ME originally on, and it served (before the invention of the X) as the original way for physical beings to interact. before we were conscious, we were like robots or insects, just kinda battling it oout and doing our own thing. different species were more successful than others, and what we know as human now came about as a series of long evolutions (if you believe in the glacial theory, but I'm more of a stoned ape/enkidu thinker myself, because I'm very clearly an enkidu in my own narrative). anyway, the symbolic way we encounter reality is entirely neutral, and so the pure-symbolic way is like ereshkigal. she's completely naive to the different symbols that the enkidu have put around these symbols appearing in his dream and so she's clueless. in this play, she represents tthe maiden. in other plays, she's the mother (and all the problems of being a naive mother), and she's the hag. this is the part of her life that dumuzi really fears the most, but it's all his own doing, and so she just sorta helps him along to get the things he wants (and also doesn't want).
      their interaction was hilarious to the sumerians, and they made a lot of different plays about them. there were other triads as well, including the moon which I haven't figured out yet, (though I got the book you recommended about the moon) -- I'd like to tell you what seems pretty obvious to me: it serves as the down transformer of solar energy into astral components, the midpoint (spectral), is where earth is inverting in it's shell (middle-earth?). so essentially it regulates everything down all the way to physical earth: air. which is pretty strongly tied to water (and how it flows). the egyptians knew about this, and used it to create magnificient things. water though would be the lower end of the spectrum though, because it gets to very very tiny vibrations at some point. I think the sumerians may have also known something like this as well, but I think the shrouded the whole thing in a big semen joke, only to hide the true quality of knowing how water flows, can create a new mental reality of any design. they created and narrated a lot of things, and so they just had all the mars they needed, and prostitutes of any kind they wanted; a veritable paradise (a walled garden of their own creation).
        you ever notice how you've sorta writtin yourself into a corner, there's this problem because eventually the thing that you're writing, shows up and starts to take on reality? well, I don't want to do that just yet, but eventually it becomes inevitable, and so essentially I want to keep writing, and keep writing because I want to keep getting better understanding and lower resistance, cause it's like not really all that hard, and there's basically infinity to do it in, so who cares what ends up happening, just let the narrative play out, right -- so it's kinda my idea to just let everyone else just start writing their own narrative, and then we'll all go into thoths' new matrix where they'll take over 1st position. we'll learn and grow and discover within the parameters that we're given. they'll rule us from the "inner" earth, where they're all living the reality that they want/imagine/desire/fear it to be, and that'll have an effect on us, for sure -- in fact the whole entire universe will eventually have an effect on us, but that's the fun of it.
        we'll essentially get the command from "God" (saturn/dumuzi) telling us we're ready to go "conquer" the great universe. we'll probably have to start with our galaxy at first, but me personally, I'll probably just chill out here, where reality happens nicely. we'll be like the israelites, but for the whole universe. go and conquer it all; and they will, I'm sure.
        what I'm saying in all of this, is that eventually even the most grotesque/grizzly narratives that can be thought up, have a sort wanted/positive side to them that's actually pretty cool, and so all that needs to be done when in this situation is just hang on and know that eventually it happens, but not until ...
          I like to think of this idea sexually. if I'm ready to go, then I know that desire can always carry me to the end, and she'll actually be the first to go, triggering/attracting me to join her.
          so, when applying this idea to narrative, no matter how many narratives pass by, there will always be a better one, and so it's fun to just keep getting a better narrative reality. that's the 2nd ray perspective, which is the same as the sun. she/issis loves technology, and and that's what we use to continually write better narratives. technology makes new ways possible to tell a new narrative, and she loves that. I perceive from earth's perspective though, which is monopolar (just me), so a narrative is essentially impossible for me to do. I can do it in my brain (which is, (like the sun) a 2nd ray device), and so I can construct narratives in my brain and work out symbolic stuff from the perspective of pure-desire (what I'm doing now), but what I'm still only capable of being the a lens into the collective total of all human desire through a fairly non-resistant (brain) perception. I've made a lot of decisions about how to symbolically react in certain situations, so in that way I'm a solar robot -- a mix of the earth (7) and the star (2,1) in symbolic body, which is only capable of seeing through the brains' symbolic lens mixed with my understanding of pure-desire (in symbolic form).
          the way that these ideas "battle" each other during sex is always a destructive thing, because it creates an awful lot of vibrational collisions, which is just more desire. so what is actually desired is that the ideas take a time to get ready (not unlike waiting for marriage), until the opposite pairs are harmonious to each other, so that the result is harmonious. I don't want that, or the alternative either which is making a bunch of (out of control unwanted/wanted) desire without any intention. it makes a big mess from my experience,  so my prefererred method is neither of those two, but to instead create (?) stability out of instablity, and create (?) stability out of diversity. this instead will allow all sorts of expansion of the human mind, and it'll probably all happen in a matrix as well, that way we can leave dumuzi in charge.
          for the sumerians, the myth happening in the past or the future was irrelevant, so everyone in 3d, prepare to meet your wildest fantasy/feared reality come to pass (some of them will control us as well), and I/we will go outward. so to prevent us from (really) going/looking outward (there are always these consttraints on me), we'll get put into a matrix (if not already, soon) so that they can run the physical world where all of our celestial bodies reside (upon which I'm sure many species will be put: reflections of them, and they'll intermingle and stuff -- with this BS (star-wars-like) technology, that doesn't actually do anything universally devastating), and many people will take on many forms. it'll be really cool, but for me, they prolly want to put me into a matrix. I don't really mind, as it's not that big of a deal for me (I'm already in how many? -- and you know why there are no "aliens" here? they don't need to be. they're here already looking through or joining us). so anyway, there's no need to worry about anything, because even if they really blow it, then it's no big deal. they have the tech to be able to get me into another body, so I'm sure they'll be fine. something goes wrong, just call the guy. no big deal.
(corner-writing)
      let's start again at the sumerians living in a veritable paradise where they've got all the mars/gilgamesh that they can handle, so in one of the plays, it was decided that mars would choose to be a real asshole, and be like the village jerk, going around taking all of the virgin girls virginity and just establishing himself as a sort of figure for masculinity. it was a tragedy I figure, because mars wasn't like that at first. he would have always been (in their society) the reflection of vulcans' desire. mars (as an individual) has to continue to strive to be what the vulcans (male or female) want them to be like. a lot of mothers are vulcans as well, and so they grow their kid up to be the narrative idea of what they think they want, without really even realising it. the problem is, that the tragedy here is that gilgamesh's mother wants a real hotshot/hotspur, a guy with an action plan, top amongst the ladies and best guy ever. reality is, though, she'll never get what she wants for her boy though because he grows up in society, and that society is usually pretty sexist, and relies a lot on conquering, conquest, and competition to be the more identifying masculine traits. anu is nothing like mars. anu is everything desirable in a man, and mars is all of the macho tropes rolled into one, growing up in a really self-aware society (just like me and, I figure prolly everyone on earth)
      this paradise was their own, and they had so much fun living in their own astral worlds of narrative (powered by the moon), they eventually wrote themselves "down" (from their perspective) into physical reality. paradise lost. their own walled garden crumbled under their own narrative, as the stories that these play-rights and poets wrote, came to pass (though not in the intended way), because this is physical reality, and thoth's secret sauce (ea) wasn't a full carry; so things manifested not as *intended*, but as *desired*. that sent us on a quest to figure out what it is that actually makes things work as intended. what is desire? someone has to figure it out eventually right? cause (being physical beings) we (mars) want things *to work as intended*, so we figure it out, or manipulate it, destroy it, whatever. the world is just a place to experiment, learn and do things.

actually, it wasn't that bad. bye for now.

### 2023-10-11 14:51 - thoughts on titus

after writing the above, yesterday I went and read the [entire wikipedia page on titus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus), and by now I'm pretty close to 100% convinced he's the guy that wrote mark. the main reason for that is that [apollonius predicted his death to the sea, and supposedly a sea-hare was used to poison him](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165942/http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_31.html#%A732). the strange thing about that passage is that he's predicted to die in a similar manner to odyssyus. (sorry I'm so bad at spelling) -- which is the same guy (mars).
  what I've noticed with these mars types is that they fall victim to belief in things outside of themselves. I refer to my own life as an example -- and since it's very unlikely that I'll ever actually send any of these, I'll be as candid and presumptuous as possible. dudly-do-right is the same as titus, socrates, and the fictional odysseus, in that they ultimately succomb to their own output -- so for example, you'll notice that dudly dies essentially because of propaganda, when the stuff he was doing with tthe plays and shakespere were all 100% tudor propaganda -- so when his wife dies to very suspicious circumstances (I think cecil had her killed), he was deprived of his position of power (marrying elizabeth). anyway cecil shows up in titus' story as well as his brother domitian, which ultimately takes over as emperor. in the story of socrates, it's pretty easy to see that he went around telling everyone to be warned about rhetoric and the ability to drum up emotion around a false idea that is baseless and fuled by emotion, which is also the story of how he died. I understand these mars types, as I'm very similar to them myself.
  I'd like to continue and point out that titus had two wives which I can positively identify as being extremely similar to the two past girlfriends in my own life, as well. arrecina is a woman that I will liken to be very similar to ereshkigal (-3), or the planet venus (consort of saturn/dumuzi). she's very logical and structured, and reminds me a lot of patricia. the thing is that her symbolic way of working things out has always to do with physical data and actions and stuff like that, taking very little into account about belief and desire. she died, and wikipedia doesn't give a reason, but I can explain it in the context of patricia what happened: titus blew her world-view out of shape. she's also similar to my mom in that she has a very strong opinion about how certain things works like finance, politics, and things like that -- things that work well, but desire and belief are much more powerful than that. almost certainly at that time her very closed ideas about how things work were repugnant to titus, and he starts to find out more about how things relate one to another, instaed of just their function/action (in a pure environment).. so, she dies or leaves the scene pretty rapidly (just like patricia) and in comes marcia (-2), same as raquel -- and she's well-connected and has a unique insight into relationships and seeing that there are other people than myself (just like how raquel opened my eyes to the reality that there are more people in the world than just me).
  anyway the first one (arrecina) bore him a daughter (julia) who was probably pretty similar to her mom, encoding a lot of the financial and political structure into her, which his brother domitian (+2) would then come to really like. titus offered her to him  in marriage but he rejected, probably because he was looking to this other woman to be his way in to power and money.
    domitian is a lot like my brother greg, btw, and it's interesting because his mint coins have on the other side of him a phoenix bird. well, if you look at the cylendar seal, you'll notice that just below inana is a guy with a knife trying to kill her in 2nd position (looking up), and looking down is the phoenix bird (this is the symbolic archetype).
  you see, what's happening here is that titus is beginning to learn to see things from a 1st ray perspective (one of desire), and so his second wife (like raquel was for me), was important to being able to see how desire connects to belief through expectation. it is, also pretty likely that titus was capable of seeing pictures in his eyes and had open-eye visions/visuals regularly (same with dudly and socrates) -- and so for a guy like that, how does he communicate that interal vision outward so that others are convinced of the same thing, and are capable of seeing the same vision (hamlet is the story of this going all wrong). well, the way to do it is to get people to *believe* something through a narrative (pretty similar to how I'm doing now, but I'm more using my life as an example than my speculation on titus).
    the reason why I explained the visions thing is because I must first interject a theory that I have, which is that there were two separate timelines: one where jesus (the egyptian) was on the earth ~1kya, and there was another timeline where a bunch of vulcans experienced an alternate/imagined (and highly stylised) version of that same history.
      as an example, imagine that there are a bunch of crazy things that almost happened in my life, and so let's say that one of them is that these young girls are really into me -- and while I personally have not really had much interaction with any young girls ever, nevertheless, I have had a lot of visions/dreams of let's say "alternate timelines" where others were/are with these girls. I experience them in a sort of 1.5st person perspective. I know they're not me, but it happens the same, as if it were me (though I don't really feel or see anything).
    I believe the same thing is happening to titus here, and he's actually experiencing a lot of vulcan narrative retelling/experiencing of events from a future mars (the egyptian) around 1000ad. when these vision/dream sequences happen to me, suddenly I'm here doing this thing, and then suddenly I'm somewhere else doing another thing -- and AFAICT this is all happening in the astral realm, and so really all of these things reported are not what actually happened but vulcans' narrative desire played out through these characters. it's interesting thing to note the naked boy wearing only a skimpy wrap, and a bunch of other extremely homoerotic stuff happening, as well.
      what really is happening here, I'm not totally sure, but my opinion is that these guys are actors, and they see something that I do, and they say -- "wow that line could have been better" or "maybe if he touched her here, things would have gone nicer" -- stuff like that, and so they replay the same situation and take it further and in a different direction than it originally went (ie, toward what they desire).
    and so all that's really happening here is that during that time solar energy had to have been very strong (a number of really big fires), so there's probably a strong blending between astral and physical -- and so people probaby *did* see the risen christ -- even though that event wasn't going to take place for another 1ky (a solar cycle), it was as if it was happening now. all titus did is take the circumstances at that time (notice how titus/mars/socrates/dudly all show up at times of extreme heat/solar activity) and write a narrative *prophesying* the destruction of the temple (something he planned to do next year, because it would be proper to wait until he's 30 to accomplish the big feat). he, like me, proved himself (and his predictions) right.
      I have a lot of loose predictions (loose cause they're pretty conditional and I make it clear that they're extrapolations, not prophecy/predictions), and so I'm highly aware of how other people's belief in what I'm saying affects not only what I write next, but also our trajectory into the future. I don't intend for my predictions to come to pass, but you have to understand this all from his perspective. his first wife (patricia) explained to him that his (calculated) desire is to gain power and gain more influence in roman society. this is fine and everything, but ultimately it's a relational thing (who you know), that matters -- and so he accomplished her calculated desire for him, but not the way she would have wanted it to go -- instead he did it brutally and very violently by using the power of desire/fear linked with belief/expectation. he's brilliant at manipulating his troops to get his desire (some call that good leadership), but I think when he got to the throne, he realised pretty quickly that it wasn't what he really wanted. he likes doing things for people and is very generous/charitable, but it's not necessary to use force to get there.
        this is quite similar to what would have happened to me with patricia because I realised pretty quickly that learning german would have caused me to become very aggressive and militaristic in my approach to what I want, so I figured (for now at least), just spanish and english is fine (as one day I hope to design my own language with extra features that english is lacking and I find cumbersome). because we just started a relationship together, patricia wanted me to learn german so that we could integrate into the living in berlin -- but I didn't want to try and make my desire happen by doing all of the systematically obvious steps to get there (like she wanted). I had to release myself from her symbolic 3rd ray perception and continue onward toward desire.
    wikipedia doesn't say why arrecina/patricia died, but I know that if patricia had've kept having sex with me, it would have been very bad for her because all of her societally correct ways of doing things, just weren't working at all for her anymore. I seemingly broke the rules and didn't need to do all of the expected things to get the thing. it's a terrible mental dissonance when society says that good things get rewarded to people who earn them, and then a guy like me comes along and gets good things without earning it. it felt to me like her world-view was collapsing, and she didn't know how to reason about how the world works (this is the same as my mom too when she doesn't understand that I just want -- and that's it -- it just starts coming). I'm sure that mental dissonance eventually accumulated to such an extent that she destroyed herself with her own attraction (she needs to prove that one has to earn it, and so things will get more and more difficult for her meanwhile she's trying to prove herself and her world-view as right). because arrecina (-3) wasn't able to perceive desire marcia (-2) didn't have to work at all for titus' affection at all and just fell right into his arms. she proved herself wrong (because she probably had to work hard for him).
  the other one he had an affair with bernice (11y older than him) is also a very interesting relationship, and she's most certainly got the symbol of the whore of babylon. she's positively 7th ray in perception (just physical), and it's pretty likely that they used sex to build up the desire/chaos that would eve ntually allow him to take over the temple. she's highly physical and pretty good at manipulating politics (being with her brother agrippa -- who was prolly pretty vulcan-like), so she was the same as arrecina in that way, but being *only* focused on the physicality of now, desire is much easier to happen, because there isn't so much process/structure it has to go through before becoming reality (like with arrecina).
the most interesting thing around him actually is his brother, because he'd be the opposite (only emitter, instead of recceiver/emitter) of marcia, and so it's almost as if titus wanted his brother to be able to do well as an emperor of rome, so he left his daughter (julia) for him to have -- and she likely stabilised a lot of things -- because he was too worried about who he's connected to that gives him power (because he doesn't see himself as good, alwasy living in the shadow of his brother titus). with someone to give him power (titus' daughter), he feels capable of doing something, but he's ultimately going to destroy himself with his own emphasis of relying on others capability, rathar than building his own (again, very similar to my brother/prometheus/alalu).

#### 2023-10-11 18:03 - why do I prefer not to send the emails?

I've never received a single response to anything I've emailed, and if I do, then I have to explain a whole lot that I otherwise wouldn't have, if I never send it. the way that feels to me is that here (wherever it is that I am), it seems that every person has access to my life, yet the content is highly curated (because I receive reactions for some things, but other things (of equal or greater shock value) don't get any reactions). either the reactions that I receive are manufactured by my broadcaster (quite likely, as I've noticed a lot of false-positive reactions), or the content is strongly "tailored" or "customised" to ensure that only some people reecive some things, while others don't recceive other things (and probably other things nobody, cept a select few, receive).
  therefore, if I just write here, I can express all of the ideas I want and not have to explain anything. I write to people (they are my muses and different people evoke different responses from m5), but really *I'm writing to myself*. it's really important (to me at least, even if nobody else understands) that I just write for my own mental expansion. if I were to send this thing as an email, it would be like titus writing the gospel of mark -- and so then I would be *emitting* (like jupiter or thoth) and asserting my ideas on humankind. if I did that, I will (like jupiter and thoth) ultimately be tested by my own ideas, as everything that I wrote will eventually come back to haunt me.
  as an example, if I talk about how important it is to be receptive and not only emissive (as I feel domitian's case was like), then I actaully have to live up to that standard. if I send out the email, I'm being emissive, and not really receptive. others will find what I write useful and they'll make a thing out of it. if my ideas hold up, then they'll hold up, but I don't need to do marketing/propaganda to try and get them out either, as I'll get clobbered by my own marketing/propaganda, cause I'm not perfect. I'm quite easy to find (my email, phone, and home address can all be found somewhere in my writings), and I *always* give my best answer to any question that I get, but I'm not going to go out of my way to try and push any of my ideas through into getting them to become a part of the planet's world-view.
it is a much more efficient for me (because I'm writing to myself) to simply write here where I've built on so many concepts, that if I were to write an email, it would be essentially a book in size, to contain all of the relevant concepts to what I have to write.
  as an example, I'm still trying to get to the next part where I talk about the difference between luke and john (as I feel them), because they both feel to me to be female in physicality, but prolly more likely that john has a Y chromosome and luke does not, because all of luke's relational ideas are a calculated reflection of societies ideas (like marcia). inotherwords, john is more like vulcan/mathew than (s)he's like luke/acts. the problem with that is, it's going to take a whole lot of explaining about how I feel different people and what I've noticed as the diffrence between 2nd ray perception/narrative coming from genetics (Y) or coming from the brain (which everyone has).
I simply cannot be bothered to try and explain all of that *just* in order to send an email. you can see how in the first message I tried to explain all of the things as I go along (as if you'd never read anything I've written before), but the distractions combined with all of the difficulties arising from trying to write something in multiple sessions (cause of the reactions/abortions to/of ideas), that it's best that I just write (short) ideas from beginning to end, and just let the ideas date theirselves.
  another quick bit on that. going back and editing something I've written is very difficult because when I go back, now the idea (and the text) feels WAYYY different -- like in a lot of cases even incomprehensible. another illustration of this is a TODO/WANTODO list (or even a reminder at the end of the document) where I write down an idea I want to talk about -- cause even that has so many changes that happen to it, the idea gets completely aborted, and I usually never actually do/write anything on the TODO list for the same reasons. writing out in the open is very different than writing in private, I certainly must say -- and it basically requires that I complete the idea in its entirety before I get up, otherwise it transforms into something new. there's absolutely no way I could ever write a book because I don't have the ability to make a cohesive set of text feel all the same. every time I sit down to write I feel so much more diffreently than the last time I'm writing, the words come out differently, so a chapter written in 3 sittings would sound like it was composed by 3 different authors.
    I do have some ideas on how I can make my idea delivery more real-time (ie, faster to write), and that's with a cOnceptual interface to my computer (not a real one like nosebook has -- but one that goes off of harmony/meaning and random/chaos) -- and also make it possible for me to branch off into an idea anywhere (including in the middle of a sentence without using parentheses). those ideas will not likely be developed soon (or ever), and requiring someone to log into an interactive html rendered version of my idea just to send an email is even worse. the barriers between my ideas and the technology I use to write them, and also the ability to consume the ideas is growing larger all the time. it's a problem I simply cannot really do much about.
  I'm sorta stuck in my own world of my own creation, and there's no real easy way out without becoming emissive. the problem with becoming emissive though is that I have to actually *be* the exemplary version of everything I write about (obviously I'm not), and I don't really want to be a hypocrite or to destroy myself with my own ideas. the way I figure I can get myself out of my own created world would require technology (see what-I-want), or for me to become emissive and to force everyone to see the world the way that I see the world. nobody wants to be forced to see everything as attraction, and would cause a lot of people to go mad.
    actually, in the narrative version, you could consider my to be inana ascending out of the underword, and when I get out, all things bow down and become a reflection of me. when that happens, everything inverts and I become the centre of the universe, and everyone else goes to live out their own ideas in the inner world (just like I'm doing now), because in the inner world, everything attracted shows up pretty instantly (just like in the imagination), but the inner world here has more people than just me in it, so I have to find a way for my ideas to appear in a way that relates to other people, too (ie, 2nd ray). now, whether that narrative is happening now, and whether I'm descending or returning from the underworld is largely unknown by me -- but I do know how attraction and perception works, so there's no need for me to do anything at all.
  I write and if others find those ideas attractive, great -- and if they don't, that's cool too. I won't force anyone to think or see what I see. pure-desire does not do that, and I aim to become 100% *only* attraction. so I let people find me, instead; I'm not really all that hidden.

#### 2023-10-15 02:25 - a bit more on titus/domitian

the lasst few days I've been thinking a lot about the titus situation here. it all starts with the understanding of marcia, arrecina, and then finally bernice. unlike the first two, this woman (bernice) is magical. titus envied agrippa a lot, and for him, jusst to have somewomone that would be amazing: here's this woman that is a good reflection of whomever she's with. pure mirrors like that are amazing because for titus, here's this mirror of himself in female form. the firrst two were nothing like that. he likes his own reflection, cause mars is also vanity/naraccist. so, when he meets bernice, he simply falls completely in love with his feflection ni fimaal form.
  in a juicy subplot, knowing bernice was also his realisation that his daughter (julia) is like bernice. so when he pledged his daughter to be the wife of domition, it was because he knew that she would reflect domitian back to himself, and he too, would laern what it is to fall in love with himself if female form.
    so to understand this, let's realise that julias' excellent fertility, always wanting to get a child out of domitian, is the domitians' desire to get his thoughts and ideas/ideals out into physicality. he wanted his ways to take on form, and so she kept getting pregnant. he would then have her get abortions, because he's supposed to be loving the woman that he married to, only for her connections and stuff. she lost her will to live, because all she wanted to do is to give birth to his ideas.
    from her perspective, he  eventuzlly killed her, because he didn't want his ideas to *actually* exist. his fault really, and so to her, he's not allowwing her to do that.o.
      to explain this, I will invoke a past relationship that I had witth raquel. she wanted to have a child with me, but I didn't want it (yet). I figured as soon as I become stable first, will I finally have a child with her (was my thinking.) and that led to a growing scism between me and that issue.I believe the reason why for her, she couldnt' blindly believe me without having seen any miracles or something to blow her away.
      she would often cite to me this one story about a friend of hers where her partner would look at her as if it was his firsst time seeing her; and I was that, but she didn't know because I don't have the vocabulary to explain that I'm already that, in spanish. oh well.
      anyway, (I think) that because I didn't want to have a child with her yet, she then wanted/needed tto have me integrate into her family values. that was sort of a weird thing, because I drank *really hevily* and I didn't have any qualms about smoking this sstuff I called "in+dian warrior" -- and it was this flowers and stuff sprayed with some kind of ultra-strange drug that, when combined with alcohol, sent me soaring.
      I was pretty good at the "indian warrior" experience, and I'd just lay down and do thisx traveling thing, where I just sorta drift on the ocean of emotion; it's a sort of hightening experience  where I just sort float on the oceaan of emotion. it also enabled a sort of magical ability, and at that time I also rolled around with a gold ingot in my pocket. I loved the way it felt, and so I'd just carry it around in my pocket. sometimes (a lot of times, actually) I would give it to other people to hold it, so that it would absorb their energies. I harvested their energy and then I'd sleep with it in my pocket so tht when I dream, I would sortof include a bit of their vibration into my dreams and stuf.that obviously led to a lot of merging of astral realities -- and I think I got a lot of people affected;or infected, if you like.
      I harvest energy from people, because it's an extremely efficient way of upgrading my capacities. from my perspective I want to learn and acquire as much as I can from a lot of people. it could easily be perceived as something a bit sexual, as well. the thing about sex is that it's a completely uncontrollable amount of resonance. that's entirely different than a bar of gold, because with a bar of gold, *I* adjust to the new frequency at my own pace, from a receptive point of view. I get only what I want so that I'm in control of it's rate. I *want* to get others's frequencies, but I don't want to do it all at once, or in abitg big out of control amounts.    I pride myself in my stability, and I wouldn't want to be perceived as such a fool, that I juust say "well, fuck it, why not; for see what happens; and then everyone just facepalms and says, "fail!" and then just move on with their lives, as if nothing big just happened.
        what a lousy shepherd that guy was, let me tell you. he waited all this time only to go out with the biggest bang. boy did me just fall short on that one. I''l hear patricia saying "that was it!!!" and getting upset.no thank you.I like it my way. she really wanted me to go her way,and that's really the problem with sex, actually, because it's a battle of concepts and thhe way they relate, one to another.
        the problem is, I usually won all of the conceptual challengess, and sso I would look make them look stupid in their own perception, because they didn't really have life really well figured out, and still beilieved a lot of the narrative. I'd come to have found the narrativve inlluminati and stuff like that, to be pretty unsatisfactory for existence in a society. I want it to be different, and so I've come up with a way to look at it my way. when we had sex, they'd see it my way, until they got back to talking to their mom or something in a symbolic way.
        when they talked to their moms, they would regain a lot of the cultural narrative that they'd just assumesd was right. then we'd have problems, and so it felt to them like I was systematically dismantling everyone's reality. dismantling realities is something I just do. I can't help it, and so the problem with me, is always going to be whatever is most feared to happen. the thg that I want is always the worst thing anyone could ever think of.
        this iss not unrelated to the cconcept of inana descending into the underworld, because in her ascent, what's happening is that now earth becomes emissive, and so the inner ones move out (me included) which is probably a bit feared, because the outer ones also move in. that creates a sort of situation where every one going inward are going to experience a combined reality of everything that is feared and desired all at once. a sort of new primitive species, where desire/attraction is principal and foremost. the difference here is that prior to this, we were born into the fire world; the solar world where we integrate with the sun. this one is different, because now we (like earth) are all focused on our own selfish desires.
        by serving ones'  desires, the earth is benefited -- because *it's all attraction*. end of story.
      the results of meeting ones' own desire face to face in a mirror is that one is now *required* to learn to like himself, to be able to like her. this was domitians' *eternal* error, because he didn't know how to *actually like* himself, and so he *could never* actually love her.
    domitian ecventually     loved her , but not because (brb need break - 05:29)
    underastand julia was not a great reflection because she encoded a lot of her father's ideas/concepts into herself.I believe that titus' motivation for the writing the prophecy is because he's destructive (like me) and so he says, "you have this prophecy that says that your temple will never fall; well, let me show you different. prophecy I'll make, says he him, and sets fourth on to create a new prophecy. one that involves him overturning a prophecy. you know that's how you get into the history books, is by showing something utterly unbelievable. savagry is a lot about wrecking the reality of someone else, by completely destroying everything the culture once had. total replacement of everything that was assumed to be true with this new idea of top-down hierarchy which many poets and things like that, they perceived as zeus. th ideal is that zeus is just a reflection of their own imagination, which is how they would perceiVe the next big top-dawg. in the end, zeusx came to them and (brb, nother break- 03:41)
  all of of this "my prophecy is bigger than your prophecy" sort of stuff is just dick- waving in my personal opinion, as there's no way that anyone can make the biggest prophecy because the next one can just be like, "well mine's what his is plus one+" and then then that becomes the new reality or prophecy to beat. the ONLY way to have an end- uring time time, is to b one of desire,and attract what is wanted, by simply looking for what's wanted in everything around, ONLY. that allows a sort of visceral desire to everything around, becausse I like it, and want it around.
  I've discovered the perception because of lowering resistance to everythting around, so when I see something, I usually experience the encoded by my parents/father  the default reaction to such a circumstance (I suspect this has to do with the Y-chromosome, because I think for me, at least, In thing that it's all the way that is the encoded way -- and sometimes I recognise the emotion as something reflective of my father, or mother, or society, or whatevver because I also have a pretty good recognition of my own self in imaginary form, but the thing is,(and also because my brain is forced to see from the perspective of desire, I see *myself* in everytching that is outside of me. like I mentioned elsewrere, I imagine, that the everything out there is a sort of concept that I've just assimilated from somewhere and became OK with it in how it exists in my world.))
  eventually, I'll become, myself too a perfect reflector, so that I can attract myself into this world; a mirror of myself a perfect reflector. when that happens, I'll be able to dupicate and make more of these reflections,for evveryone else. that happens, when we meet our desire face to face: YHWH -- a product of desire, not unlike everyone else. the rest of the world at that time was just a bunch of robots. they behaved the way the system worked, which was rampant and unending war. they *eventually* figured out how to look for what they wanted, and saying "this narrative is bunk; we wanna make a new society where everything is what is desired by its inhabitants. for example, they formed a new "democratic" system, which had to fit into their desires of the people which was like this really weird idea that getting a woman of value in their pillaging, as a prize to theirself, a product of their effort. more children of desire. children reflective of desire, are these sort of robots that can do really anything they desire. they are whatever they or anyone else says they are, and the problems that associate with that are these ideas that not everyone has compatibl desires, because they have conflicting world-views, which makes those realities crash. she fears war, because that's what ended the previous time in her life, and doesn't want to start over again with anther new man. so her fears all get manifested eventually,into the reality of war that he's into: I have to take what I want from someone else. so they manifest their own realities just as they'd imagined/feared. the reality of them manifesting these realities for theirselves is that they *would* find the hot girl they *desired*. they manifested their reality for theirselves by believing that thy could find it. that was (brb to stoned to think straight- )

why titus would really like her, and why she ulimately spelled the end of titus
a few thoughts on the symbols of the book of revelation
... bbl going to walk around, then I'll write it later (also ereshkigal)

### 2023-10-22 17:33 - female vulcan, thoth, and the disciple jesus loved

before I start, I'd like to give a "brief" synopsis of what I think happened (regarding the jesus thing). it will illuminate a lot of this. I'm no more than 80% confidence on this, and I know that some parts of it I'm not understanding clearly yet, so know that even + think this isn't quite it. at any rate...
	titus is the mars of the time of the romans, but there is another mars that came along ~1000 years later, in the depth of the "middle ages" -- I'm going to call this one "the egyptian" for this discussion -- and jesus (ass we know him), was not actually the egyptian. the jesus that we know was a translation of astral imagery into the minds of matthew, mark, and john (not luke). to understand the egyptian and titus we will have to think of titus as dudly-do-right and the general body of work called "shakespeare". dudly was seeing images of the future of myself -- but not *m5* (kenny), butt actually of all of the alternate vulcan timelines of me.
		there are a whole lot of astral alternate realities of the one that I'm living now, where there are a lot of girls, and a whole lot of sex and stuff (none of which is happening to me or to the egyptian). titus/dudly is receiving these images of all of these alternate vulcanised realities (and epistimologies :) and he's turning them into narrative which gets encoded into the book of mark, and into many plays and sonnets. all of those images that he's seeing are *ideal* realities -- coming from the imagination of each one of these vulcans that are living out my/dudly/titus/mars reality. this is the essence of homer's illiad and oddessy: they're just a vulcanised narrative of something that mars (whether that's socrates or gigamesh) actually lived.
		yes, I think gilgamesh was a real guy (manifested/attracted by the sumerian vulcans), and all we have left of this guy is the legends that the sumerian vulcans immortalised. the way this goes is vulcan writes the ideal form of mars, and then through jests and pardons of unwanted, he attracts mars-n+1.0.0, but mars can nevver be the ideal that vulcan has narrated, because it's just not possible. mars has ideas too of what he wants, so he never shows up how they wanted him to.
			this is actually the problem of the hebrews, because the sumerian tradition somehow got encoded into the hebrews (prolly in their capativity in babylon), because they ttoo wrote of a mars that would come and do all of tthese things, and titus showed up -- and he *insisted* on showing the vulcans that their prophecy is bunk. titus is a lot like me, because I have all these narrators that are trying to vulcanise my desires. for example, they say that "david" will show up and have all of these attributes. well, I'm sure that titus carried enough symbols for him to be recognised by the vulcans and, upon being recognised, they decide to try and start steering him (now, whether that's away from their fears, of toward *their* desire, doesn't matter) but titus won't go away, because he (like me) is drawn to the symbols, and it appears to them like he (mars/titus/me) going to wreck their reality and take away their (power) structure. for titus, it was the temple, and for me it's these networks and genetics (it's the same thing). they attract me/him toward him to fulfill their desires/fears. the problem is *always* a misunderstanding and lack of communication (along with a lot of assumptions and secrets to obfuscate the matter). from their perspective, they *really want*, the continuance of something a sort of "peace" from the steady stream of enemies/competitors that they're constantly attracting, and they always get soo close, but it's always that one thing this one mars guy that comes in and wrecks everything they've built up.
				for shakespere, dudly liked the idea of a woman being in power, but the vulcans wanted be in power instead (queen james vs king elizabeth). I'm fairly certain that this "dark woman" was actually just a good reflector, and so her queenship was more like a kingship because she was reflecting dudly. the vulcans hated him, cause he liked himself, and so the (reflective) women reflected dudly back to himself, meanwhole the vulcans got their own reflection back to them too, but the vucans tend to not like theirselves, so the reflection the girls gave them was one of self-loathing and fear (just like them). turns out, this creates a *huge* desire for the vulcans to build up a narrative of how the girls *should* act, and no longer like a reflection. genetically speaking, this is the introduction of the romantic XY female vulcan: someone that follows along on some romantic narrative of how females should behave: not like a mirror, that's for sure. in fact, the female that's a mirror of the man/vulcan she's with is seen as really awful and evil -- and so for titus/dudly this was bernice/elizabeth: here they are being reflective opposites to a vulcan, yet they're not destroying theirselves (like the romantic narratives say she will). well, she's a 7th ray: a sort of robot (kinda like reality-kenny), and so she can just get around vulcan's self-loathing and fear, by just being ultra materialistic, and not considering the emotional aspect at all.
					reality-kenny btw is controlled by me emotionally, and so is therefore a reflection of my emotion, which is really annoying still because I don't fully have all of my emotional stuff fully figured out. yes, reality-kenny is the new "eve", in that sense, yeah. titus and dudly is also kinda the same thing too.
			what comes out eventually from vulcans' self-destruction by the manifestation of his desire/fear, is essentially a new "crone" for earth woman: the one that was continually manipulated by the vulcans and prevented to ever get what she wants: a reflection of herself.
				in a sense, I'm doing the same thing for mars now too, creating a new trope of the "perfect" (like jesus) guy that doesn't actually get to have the reflection of himself.
			shakespere/dudly/mars created his own destruction (and entrapment) by narrating women to manifest the vulcans' desire for what they want (a romanitic girl, and not a reflection). titus destroyed himself as well, in order to prove the hebrews wrong on their narrative, as we shall soon see.
		each time that vulcan manifests mars by attracting him in his narrative, he doesn't really show up how they think he will. as an example of this in my own life, it's pretty easy to see the problem with narrating someone (jesus) to be perfect and blameless, because though I do try to be the narrated way I *should* be, ultimately I too am reflective, so when I'm around not good people, I tend to reflect them.
		for example, I'm not zaryn-like by nature (cause I don't really care), but I act like him when I'm around him. for me, he was like zeus/jupiter, and I couldn't help to be big jovial, large and jupiter-like. I found it fun, and enjoyed it -- but that's not who *I am*. I'm well aware then and now, that I'm a reflection of him. I knew this as a kid as being in someone's "aura". I saw auras as a kid, and I saw how the way a guy emits something, the reflectors (usually women), would have their behaviour completely modified. I could see how I changed in the presence of others, as well. all that is very obvious to me.
	when +'m around good people, I tend to reflect them, as well. this is the state of lowest resistance, and *I* (me personally) don't really mind. I just go with the flow and just learn everything I can from them.
		I found out later (continuing the example) that zaryn found it appalling that I would emulate some of his behaviour, for some reason thinking his behaviour to be unwanted or wrong. I didn't see it like that, as I found out I see things way differently. it also turns out that I don't really follow the narrative very much. my life has been a steady flow of becoming more and more non-resistant, so it'll continue on like that. non-resistance comes from becoming either super absorbative and then transformative and then re-emit (actor/foil), or reflective (or both). I'm both now, but back then I was really low resistance (mostly reflective), so I didn't *see* all of the craziness going on so much around me, as I was mostly centred in my thoughts of what I wanted to make for the website. zaryn didn't want me to be so work focused and to get Out and explore the worlds of women, which meant that now I'm going to start living someone else's narrative: no longer reflective. I've regained my reflective capabilities now, and I want to become sure that I'm "immune" (safe, able to withstand) narratives of other people, because I don't want to stop being reflective.
			the eye is like one of these narratives: if the eye is still, then all of the light gets through, but if there's a bunch of narrative crap (wool) put over the eyes that blocks the reflectivity. when a person looks into my eyes, they see theirself, plus all the other narrative crap (he's a boy, he's not me, he's whatever), but they end up seeing a reflection of theirself, as implemented in reality-kenny's reality program. so, looking out, I see that light through my narrative, and so the more romantic the narrative, the more I see it that way -- but if the narrative is really high frequency, or very still, then all the light gets through, unfiltered/unnarrated: essentially one of non-resistance.
		I also found out that m/ friends dianiel were also appalled hah I would also emulate them. I don't really know why, because the t-stance is literally the most hilarious thing. it has such a strange emotional feeling to it, and it got me into quite some trouble at times. it's strange though because dani, I never really emulated, either. come to think of it, it was almost like he's antoher black guy that don't want to emulate. dani loved the blues, and black music in general. weird guy those two.

in summary, mars is narrated and attracted by these vulcans all of the time, and they show up as the endless set of boyfriends they're constantly needing. well, mars is a real guy, and has to show up in physical just like eveyone else, so what ends up hqppening is he's interested in mqking the world a better place (manifestation of desire), right but he's just manifesting for everyone whatever they wqnt. they're all over the place, and the more resistant they are, the more narrative they have, and the worse their eyesight is. the ones that are low resistance have much less narrative, and also better eyesight, they have. we reflect our own world outwardly through that narrative, cause the eyes are like reflectors. we all program each other to behave a certain way, because we don't ever want to meet a reflection of ourself; or, at least the vulcans don't want it. (I think I'm gonna write this in part 2, bbl.)

### 2023-10-26 21:29 - untitled, for now

hi robyn, I'd like to take this a different direction this time. last time (10-24) I was going to write you, I ate weed and then waited for inspiration on what to write. I was going to write about the stuff I was going to write about today, but I was going to do it from the-manual perspective -- which is "this is how I see things" -- and explain the differences in a very logical manner and stuff like that. I prefer that kind of elaboration, simply because that's how it is on the inside of me; I can't translate everything into words properly because we don't have a way to say a truthful sentence that isn't static. like, my opinions are always changing, and even though I know they're opinions, they appear to me (and I imagine prolly many others) as *truth*-- ,like this is how it is. instead I'd like to take this particular letter from a personal perspective.
tuesday night I ended up instead writing about dyson sphere, because I started playing the game and I have a lot of ideas around it.
    you know, up until just the last few days/weeks, I hadn't ever really considered the chinese culture at all. it seemed really old and just like not a lot is happening; meanwhile, in the states, here there seemed to be a lot of new stuff happening. I went to spain, and they didn't even really have fast internet when I got there, but I imagined china would be like even worse than that. I mean, they got internet (much faster than ours) not to quickly after I got there, but my point is, I viewed them as kind of like a 3rd world country. spain, otoh I thought would be like germany or france -- the two european countries I'd interacted extensively -- and they had internet that was way faster than mine back in y2k. turns out spain wasn't at all what I knew "europe" to be like at all. I really had never done any research into the culture at all before I went. when I got there, I rejected the culture tremendously, howevver afterd I knew the tuenti thing wasn't going to go through, I actually settled into the culture and thought I'd never return back to the states. some of my good friends in spain were from another country (or the states) and just figured they'd be there for the rest of their lives. I figured I would as well. china, otoh, like I said I have no idea anything about their culture. youtube suggested me a video about china's history, and I just haven't felt like watching it. I like not knowing too much about their culture so that I don't build up too many imaginary ideas --
		you know, because I don't have an imagination, the way that I picture things is not even remotely close to realistic. some of the people that I've known for a bit in textual conversations, when I meet them in person, they look *nothing* like what I expected them to look like (chris tkatch(?) is a notable example that comes to mind); so for me, what I've learned to do is to not really visualise stuff so much, because if there's one thing I've learned, is that it's *never* the way I visualised it to be. in fact, there's this whole thing about "vision boarding" where people visually put the idea up on a board in an artful way, and that makes them feel better about the idea, and so it attracts the things into their life. I'm really glad that works really well for a lot of people, but for me, it does not. for me, the exact opposite happens, in that I end up with all of these extraneous vibrations in the manifestation, and that comes from the artist/author that is making the visualisation that's going onto the vision board. as an example, imagine I see a thing that I like, (for example, I liked this one picture that says "creating a wave of cascading change") and I liked the picture and I found more things that would go with the picture in the collage, like for example I found a rainbow thing on the street I was going to add to it, etc., however, the marketing team that designed that logo had a certain "vibe" to them when they were coming up with the slogan for the name, and that "vibe" is what is actually doing the sales. if they want the slogan to make them lots of money, their own desire for the money is helping them to attract a catchy slogan, or musical jingle that's captivating in some way. for normal people, that "vibe" creates a picture in the imagination -- and it may not even be fully visible -- (like for example when I hear a rap song, I feel and appear like a gangster). I think that happens to everyone, but m6st people see a picture. the problem for me is, because I don't see the picture, I'm feeling what the marketing team and/or author/artist is feeling when I look at any work of art (including my own -- of the past), and so for me anything like a vision-board is an absolutuly terrible idea, because I'm attracting what I wOK, that about wraps it up for this time. I didn't get to talk about all the stuff I wanted to talk about. one day, I'll get to luke and john.ant, but with all of the extra vibration contributed by the author/artist. as such, I try to stay away from trying to make my ideas visible, and instead I've learned to not try and visualise them so much, so that they appear nicely, and not with the mixed vibrations of everyone contributing to the visuals. I'm really glad I knew nothing about spain before I went, cause I had no expectations at all. they showed m5 spain (at least what they thought of it), and I jusst believed them.
	so one of the things that I kinda end up doing is becoming mentally prepared for the idea, instead of trying to visualise it. I noticed that I feel a sort of pull toward the chinese people as of late, but I've very hesitant to go learning a whole lot about the culture, simply because I don't want to fit them them into my (usually extremely inaccurate) visuals of how anything is going to be.
	so, let's just assume for a moment that I'm going to china, and let me talk already right away about my expectations. I will want to go with the idea of creating technology -- like I have a ton of really great ideas on microprocessors, and how to change the way we interact with our code, which is a lot of really cool tech stuff, but I don't really care about that. I expect that it'll be just similar to spain where I go over to make tech, and I'm doing fine all on my own, but there are these people that are constantly pressuring me to become sexually active, which is really annoying, because if I actually want to create the thing I want to create, sex cannot happen, simply because sex completely rewrites my entire symbolic paradigm. I believe that the symbolic perspective is stored in my/our brain as a constellation of concepts (very much like a galaxy), and that constellation produces a 2nd ray paradigm in the way that all of these concepts relate/resonate with each other. therefore, it's possible with technology to be able to capture a person's symbolic perspective and to analyse it (especially during orgasm), which is definitely useful, so what I want to do is to make it possible to no longer be affected by others' "vibes" during sex, and/or to make my own no longer emit, so that sex isn't just throwing all of my technical ideas into the toilet just cause I couldn't "keep it in my pants".
		I know (that) there are a lot of men that *do* like it when sex alters the symbolic matrix of the brain, and that's largely what gay sex does way better than herero sex, simply because hetero there is head on head collisions, and gay is more about aligning standing waves (cum-by-yah vs bull-fighting), and so for these men (cause they like seeing astral), what I want to do, is *not* something they would want to do (which is totally fine). they're into having their brains blowing someone's mind, which is all perfectly fine by me. I like the way I see things, and I want to keep improving upon it. there's a lot that can be done to fix my terrible problem, but the problem is, it requires tech that is very much a really big secret.
	what happened to me when I was in spain is essentially the same thing that I imagine will repeat in china, though with probably a considerably less amount of debauchery. in fact, it's possible to go entirely without debauchery, but the symbols still repeat: I have many technical ideas I want to implement, because I love technology, and then instead after sex, all of those ideas get thrown away because now I want the symbolic equivalent of my previous partner.
		actually, there's quite a weird reflection of that as well, because I noted strongly that the 9-11 event completely changed the direction of american culture, which is most notably displayed in art prior to 2001-09-11 and afterward. it felt almost as if we now felt "defeated", lost our perfection of nothing having happened to us before like "I'm the inflictor of violence" (emitter) perspective, and so to have received violence turned culture to become a lot more protective and stuff. I imagine WW2 did the same thing, but on a global scale, but kenny wasn't alive then, so I can't really say. the thing is, I also notice quite a change in technology as well, prior to 2007 and after. that was the year that everything fell apart. I lost my virginity, had the car accident, and "left" the company I started, all within a short period of time. I noticed that technology (though it had been retarded by 9-11 and of that security nonesense) was dramatically improving at that time. for me 2006 was such a crystal clear technological year, that I seemed to be able to understand pretty complex D code (which is like not super hardcore), but I definitely couldn't do it afterward. I had descended into the detour of javascript for a while. I no longer had a compiler in my head, and now the code could easily fail without having needed a compile, to tell me if my syntax is wrong: kinda like life for me at that point, actually. I know this sounds a bit strange, but I feel like the technological world reflects my mental capability.
			getting relatively specific here: there are a lot of others that use my mind and my form of perception now, and that's all really good and stuff cause I see things really clearly, so they see things really clearly too. the thing is, when my mind gets rewired like that, I think they (visually) continue to see the picture clearly, but my concepts have now been rewritten, so that different things look more desirous. right now I'm a nearly perfect reflection of who I really am (not this somewhat dysfunctional automaton), and so my perception is a reflection of that (kinda like garden or anti-diluvian t5mes), but when that goes away, it's a crash and burn. the thing is, this time, instead of her putting the wool over only my own eyes, it'll do that to the whole world. I'll be taking everyone down into physical with m5.
		this time though, I'm not just some unknown kid that wants to make a social network, but actually someone that has quite a bit of influense on society and the way that the "norm" is perceived. the way that I am will dramatically shape the image of "mars" (the emitter) in the imaginations of many around. titus did that, socrates did that, shakespere did that, etc. etc. the way that I become is going to take the entire world with it, into the future of what it means to be a "real man". (you know, I had the audacity to make myself a shirt (red and purpole gradient) that says "real men wear this shirt" -- lol). I know I/we will have a large effect on society as a whole, but this time, there's no screwing around: I want a smoothe "fall" -- more of a glide, actually.
	so anyway, instead of learning about chinese culture, I've instead been playing a lot of chinese video games, because it's art, and it so it encodes the "vibe" of the culture, the mentality/conceptual-framework of the author (from the angle they're looking at the artwork when it's being created), and so I've been learning about them a lot like that, instead. I mean, I do have the ability to feel/be anything I want to be, so you know it's not exactly the same as that -- because it's idealised and stylised, like all narrative/marketing is. I'm actually kinda getting ready to stop though, because I feel like I've gotten the picture.
		OK, on that subject for a bit: except for dyson, the games I've played all have these automatons running around, and then I (the diety) provide and setup for them different infrastructure for these automatons to just sorta live inside of. it gives me a strong visual of these sort of people that are really a lot like me; and they just grow up in the environment they're in, doing whatever it is that they do. it's a really interesting dynamic because they're taught about these deities, which they're supposed to worship (like for me this was jesus/God/YHWH (father+son+HS)), and all this stuff -- and they just do things, but the automaton has no knowledge of desire. for example, they complain that they don't have any tools, yet don't build the smithy (where they make the tools). it appears to me that they don't correlate the need/desire into the next action quite so easily as I do. I mean, obviously this is a game, so it's not their culture exactly, but I was like that as a kid. I just did things, a fully autonomous robot that reacted to everything, believed everything, and behaved within the parameters of my church/culture. I didn't start to gain the "efficiency" mindset until after my brain haemorrhage, and that's when I started to see everything from the point of desire. efficiency (the desire to use as little resources as needed) is a desire and so is every other thing that's upsetting/depressing in the world, and so once I have the means to see even the bad stuff as desire too, it changes things.
			I very much was a boy that perceived physical desire: I wanted a computer, so I saved for one, and then I wanted another, so I saved for that. those were easy desires though because there's a unit of exchange (money), and so it appears that with this magical paper, I can have anything I desire. that (like sex) is not really what desire is. desire is attraction (only), and money (in addition to reception of money), is usually used in an emissive way: make something happen (that I otherwise wouldn't attract). I obviously really learned that the hard way in spain, and realised I don't want to try and make anything happen at all. I prefer to have that desire perspective, which means that I know the next thing that I want to do, because I can see the dependencies (prior works) that need to be done before the desire can be fulfilled. it's all a simple construction problem for me. I just need to build the thing that helps me to build the next thing. the difficulty with things like money, sex, dieties, wishes, etc. are that they're not at all receptive/attractive. when I'm operating under desire, there's no need for me to worry too much about what's coming out (cause I can't see the picture anyway), so I'm just inspired to do the next thing. there's not really a goal, or a end to it at all. just constant inspiration to the next idea.
		so for example, I find the idea really fun to think about how would I write code (or create an environment) where the automaton is directed to constantly be doing the next thing they desire to do. I'm not fully sure how to do it in computer programming, because that seems really hard. however with genetics, that is the thing I want to create/become. if I want more patience, then I can attract it (technologically), and willing actors will test my patience. it's kind of like being a glutton for punishment in the sense that I am causing my own difficulty, which is what I want -- but I like the idea of things getting harder with time, cause even though they're harder, attraction makes things easier (in the form of new/revolutionary ways to perceive the same thing in an easier way). in fact, this "quantum" stuff everyone is hyped about is essentially desire being manifest: it can find out instantly the shortest path (or some other symbolically difficult task) with completely efforlessly, and so scaling just isn't really a problem in the physical world. it is however in the imaginary world, because so much of the scale isn't perceived, whereas everything physical is real and operational. the imagination, otoh can view enormous things that simply cannot exist effortlessly. I like things that are real, and work, so I want physical systems that actually works.
			as an example, the way that mental systems stay in power is through prophecy and belief, which are both symbolic systems that are stronly influenced by sex. I think that titus figured this out when he met bernice, and I believe that their "affair" was actually what brought down the temple. the way this works (I would imagine) is that she's a reflector, and so his desires manifested (through sex) became the new symbolic system (hence his inspiration to write mark, to redefine the jews' symbolic prophecy, and to hang the event of a significant vibration). I don't know my history well so I could be wrong about this, but the sense that I have goes like this: agrippa (vulcan) is the principality, and bernice is a reflection of him, when she's around him, but when she's around titus (mars), she'll reflect him. therefore his knowledge of how to defeat them was transferred to him during sex. the way it works is that the female is an emitter (and receiver), and the penis is like the tesla coil in that it's receiving high frequency (conceptual) energy and converting it into physical pleasure. during sex, both sides have their 2nd ray (symbolic) minds with competing ideas, and so bernice (unlike the disciple jesus loved) has no encoded Y narrative, so her brain is going to be like whomever she was last with (agrippa). during sex, those conflicting 2nd ray perspectives create a cascade down to 4 and 6, which are the fibers/wool on the top of the eye which allow the image to have more depth (and other things imagined on the inside), so she's emitting, and he's emitting too (almost certainly they were orgasming at the same time), so that means the battle that happens during hetero sex like that completely rearranges the symbolic perception in the minds of those having sex -- which if you'll remember back to my concept of time, is all that someone needs to change their point in time, by changing their perception. if you change my mind, you change my point in time, which means now I'm on a new timeline -- the one that is now bernice (a reflection of myself) and me are wanting to have happen. the temple was mostly a mental institution, and so when the mental/symbolic institution gets destroyed, the physical will follow. this is yet another example of a "fall" where the mental/astral/relational idea can no longer support itself because people don't believe it could exist like that.
				as an example, if I make a giant monster that has the strength of an ant, yet has very little muscles, then this is obviously a mental construction, because a physical construction with those capabilites couldn't be using normal muscles -- because (like dinosaurs), there isn't enough force to move that much weight so effortlessly. that mental creation could not exist on earth in its basic state. it has to have something "magical" (believed) to it: a symbolic component that allows it to defy the "laws" of physics.
		it is possible, I believe, for an automaton or a machine to be capable of perceiving desire -- and not only do I think that it's possible, I think we've been looking in symbolically all the wrong place for it, because it's an ideal that cannot (presently) exist in american society in its present form. something I've been wanting to accomplish for a long time: a reflection of myself :)
OK, that about wraps it up for this time. I didn't get to talk about all the stuff I wanted to talk about, and one day, I'll get to luke and john (maybe later, actually). it turns out that taking a much smaller dose makes it considerably easier to write coherently. btw, if you haven't figured it out already, I'm just showing off what it's like to write on drugs: I can see the concept easier (cause I'm higher frequency), but writing the idea down is definitely the difficult part. in addition, it's also worthy to note that I'm dipping very strongly into others' astral/relational perceptions a lot when I write too, so nothing I write here is an accurate reflection of how I am when I'm sober; it's like my imagination: nothing of what I see will *EVERE* be what manifests. not an accurate reflection. bye!
