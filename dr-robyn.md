### 2023-10-10 00:30 - first message

hi, I thought to message you ever single myth-vision video that I saw, but I don't really know what I want to say. so, I'm just going to write. I'll start off with an explanation of my version of "history" (and how time works), and then follow it up with some thoughts on "who wrote the gospels".

I could never be a classical "historian" in the traditional sense, simply because I believe that every timeline which arrives to the present to be a valid one. most of "history" has been a fight over which narrative is the "right" one -- and anyone who doesn't believe the same way as we (some culture group with an origin story) do, should be exterminated, so that the whole entire planet can live in harmony, and believe the same thing. as such, we try to get everyone on earth "on the same page", and so the various narratives that exist are an effort to try and bring every human being on earth into the same global imagination of how the "past" was.
  to understand what I mean by this, let us imagine an imaginary or astral earth, which is not at all unlike how our own builds a world-view of something: a global concept of how everything fits together. multiple world-views exist on this planet, and there are as many of them as there are conscious human beings. we might imagine each one of these world-views as a sort of point (of light, like a star) in a sort of cloud: some world-views are closer to others than others -- and so you may have millions in the islam grouping, and a bunch in the big christian grouping, but upon looking closer, there are a number of different minor groupings as well corresponding to different denominations, orthodox, and minor sects, all the way down to small groupings of cults and things like that.
  each one of these world-views has a different version of how "history" is formed, with nobody having a complete picture of it all. some historians and academics align themselves more to one grouping of world-views than another, but it must be understood that all of these groups have massive "blind spots" where aspects have not been considered or cannot be known with our present level of technology
    which, I do believe that time machines do exist, however a time traveler can go to *any time* (even one that academics would call a ficticious one) -- as long as the tim5 corresponds with the rest of the beliefs in the travelers' world-views: so like gravity has to work, and the sun has to be there and, precipitation cycle is pretty much the same; all the important stuff. as such, time machines are not actually used to explore the "past" -- because *anything* is possible, but instead used to adjust our trajectory into the future (which is just a (symbolic) world-view grouping extrapolated into the future) -- because everyone experiencing that alternate past *believes* it, and so when they return to the "present" (they never left the present), they *believe* that to be the past, and so their world-view has been updated to reflect that, which then through intercourse of ideas, other world-views get updated as well. (I say "updated" but all of these points are in motion, again, a lot like stars)
  therefore, I'm not going to try and conclusively sell you or anyone else on any form of history (in science terms, I'm saying I don't offer a comprehensive 4d schema/trajectory; instead, I offer the 5d perspective).

now, when I suggest the ideas in the following bits about "who wrote the gospels", consider that I'm drawing a lot off of a [centre-place lecture of the same name](https://youtu.be/BT12rsfvnhI) which I watched last night, and today youtube suggested me to watch [your myth-vision video](https://youtu.be/uINo-f7xG9g) of the same title, as well about an hour ago. I also want to be clear that this idea came to me only last night after watching that video.
essentially the idea goes to me like this: mark sounds like a guy like me that's writing. I often times misquote things because I've stored the concept in my brain of what the text says in that section, and so when I retrieve it, I translate the concept back into english or spanish (are my only two options right now). I can also turn the idea into flow-charts and timelines too, so it doesn't have to only natural language as its output. I often times translate words and ideas into mental art and pictures (which I don't "see" with my eyes -- but they exist internally -- much like the world-views)
  in fact there's a lot of similarity between the world-views perspective to history and what I call "conceptual perception", as one of my concepts (which is all a world-view really is) can easily be compared with another concept, and bigger concepts -- and some more abstract, sorta like how I can "feel" (or things "sound") to me like a thing/narrative I heard somewhere else. I can compare my concepts/world-views to others concepts/world-views with ease (though none of them have names -- just feelings) and the result is a feeling (which I experience as a giant picture) of how the world works. in fact, I am doing that right this very moment while writing to you, as I look at the same thing/concept/world-view from a slightly different angle and write another sentence. I've learned enough knowledge and paid enough attention to how to formulate sentences, and each sentence formulation has a "feel" to it. some sentences feel or "sound" better than others. (shakespere is a study into how to make certain ideas "sound" really awesome, so he too has the ability to feel how a sentence "sounds" (not with ears)).
as I was watching the centre-place lecture the author of mark sounded vvery roman to me. in fact, he sounded to me like being specifically from the flavain dynasty. the idea that came to me is that this gospel was probably written in 69 as a sort of self-prophesying *proof* that such a thing would happen -- because it was either be someone that titus hired to write, or titus himself that wrote it. I believe the latter, and I'll take the next section to "prove" it before moving on to the other three.
  I must noww introduce the concept of the triad, and this is an extremely noticeable triad in most all of modern literatere. the three players are mars, vulcan, and venus/aphrodite. the woman is the most interesting, because she is earth; a shapeshifter taking on the form of (almost?) every human being on the planet. she is gaia, the shapeshifter, the puma, the black condor, owl, dove, venus, aphrodite,... I personally find her the most remarkable of them because of her role as ishtar/inana in the sumerian civilisation (who were mostly a bunch of vulcan/enkidu and mars types + (prostitutes?)). in the book of revelation, she's "the great whore", but she's the same inana that descends into the underworld.
    OK, I really need to pause a moment and go over some sumerian mythology: the first world-view -- until a bunch of try-hards tried to turn it into what they think it should be: us, the aryans :) well, OK, I'm trying to be too salacious here...
    inana/aphrodite is who I will call earth which I'll call "7th ray or physical perception"; and that's where the star on the inside of the earth's spherical resonator slows down pretty rapidly (our atmosphere is only a few hundred km tall) to zero, and then inverts itself (very much like the skull of the head -- notice the iconography). there is an inner earth just like there is an inner skull, where our imagination resides (where these world-views/concepts get manifest into visual/imaginary/astral). the planet is the same, also having an outer-skull area where everything else *outside* of "self" is *percieved*, and all of the inner-skull stuff is *real* (or is it the other way around?).
    mars is the masculine version of that. our bodies are receptive beings: we receive all sorts of signals which then a bunch gets filtered out and transformed into a physical/visceral (happening in the body) sensation. mars has a narrative big-picture of how all of those signals/symbols fit together; an internal world-view. I equate the this narrative structure to the Y chromosome.
    vulcan well, remember how our bodies are receptive beings? each of those receptions have a mental representation as well as physical; so, just as each neuron has a whatever vultage in relation to another, so too do these relations exist with the world-view of the person on the mental plane (the one that astral/imaginary is made of). so he's exactly like mars in that he has a symbolic representation of something encoded within a matrix of relations between concepts/ideas/world-views. I also equate him with the Y chromosome.
    those three characters (mars|aphrodite|vulcan) exist in essentially every mythology available to us in cOncept.
    for the sumerians, this was gilgamesh (mars), enkidu (vulcan), the prostitute (brb 03:12)

    (if I may interject a moment here a brief commentary on what it's like publishing my thoughts so regularly: every publish causes a complete abortion of the idea/concept for me, and when I go back to the idea I once had (before publish) is actually gone; I can't access it anymore. it's changed so much that it's unrecognisable to me; but then, I just learn a new way to see the idea before I published it. for most people, the abortion of an idea like that is often devastating, and for mee it was a lot as well. I eventually got pretty good at finding the new concept, because it's pretty easy: the better version of the concept feels better than the previous one. I sort of do all of this on purpose, because it shows that my concepts are constantly updating, even if the text on it dates itself pretty quickly. what I then do, is I simply repeat/relate the same concepts in newer more complex ways all of the time. the mental expansion that I receive from doing it is insane. many podcasters and the like know that mental expansxionn happens prretty rapidly, once I start telling my thoughts out loud (or trying to render them as best/clear as possible), what ends up happening is that because I'm constantly updating the text of the concept, to kind of render the concept in a more expansive way)
    (if I may continue, as we'll soon see, further down in the thesis, I need to find a technology or some capacity to allow others to esssentially "undo" my teachings on the idea, and learn it their own way. this is essentially the technology that is desired, which is that for novelty to turn into diversity (until more novelty is desired). I'll explain more later -- however what's (I think is) really happening here is that my conceptual world is growing at a magnificent rate, and more and more things will depend on me, and treat me like they treat earth: exploit my body. it's normal right? for me it is, and so that kinda makes me the universe (ie, soemone who lives forever, because of such monumental desire for my existence for longer than a single lifetime can imagine: the product of a corporation -- something that lives for a long time, and strongly depends on me). you know, as I was thinking earlier, one of the cool things I'd like to do is to make it possible for everyone to be able to (once/as we all become weightless) reduce different conceptual resistances (conceptual changes to their form), so for example they could "upgrade" their patience to a higher level (the details are kinda gorey, which is that I don't know technolgically how anyone could do it the "easy" way, but I'm sure some will figure it out -- I just make a desire which is like a really complex high-frequency vibration -- I dunno, with how I feel or perhaps "know" it could feel (like) -- and anyway that complex wave attracts the desired signal -- so my rememberance/memory of that desire is always in the old (recognised) form, so I just have to find the better feeling concept/recognition of the old form --- so I go bouncing higher and higher all the time, cause I like to :) and it's fun.) anyway, where was I? OH YES)

  before I continue, I just want to say that this is *my* (very not final version) of sumerian mythology, from which I've based this "understanding" that I have of it. I don't really have any thing to say what I've got is the *final* answer in any way. what I have is a working intuition of how things are. the main property of 3d earth, is that everything is constantly in a flux of change. I model my work on that concept, that everything I write, and I'd admit that it's going per- word/concept where it suddenly gets "outdated" on me. often times as a pastime, I go in to check in on some of these concepts, after they've been reacted to; because, here's the deal: I think I have the best most comprehensive world-view out there at the moment, but there's no stopping anyone else from having the same realisation. that's the moment of enlightenment: it's OK to be different/better/awesomemore than evveryone else. + want to display that it's possible to manipulate the conceptual world with one's perception of an idea. the perception is really a 2nd ray (relational) thing that exists not only in the conceptual, but also in the physical brain. the combination of these two signals is very high frequency, so it's basically invisible. I'm fairly certain that I get mine hijacked all the time, and I don't know if it's my own code/cconcepts that are making these things appear or not (I'm a pretty creative person) so it's likely my (I would suppose) own doing. nevermind that. the result is I'm constantling having to find a higher and higher frequency (ie, lower and lower resistance) which is the definition of desire pretty much; that attribute alone, convinces me that I/kenny have lowered my resistance to enough concepts that I've become quite flexible in space and time. everyone can do it. I claim that we all have the earth in us, and we're literally the only ones that are holding us back from that spanning space and perception because of our own resistance: I have to be this to this person; that to another person; this way at church, and that way at school. (sorry to get preachy. I think I was channeling you a bit there. anyway) and so what we end up here is everyone fitting into that conceptual percception through symbol and myth. symbol and myth are all the building blocks that one needs to create an artificial reality. each of these symbolic structures eventually breaks because it's no longer useful -- or rather I should say no longer desired. desire is constantly going higher and higher frequency, and so it's never able to stop. the only place that desire can manifest is into a fully *3d* body. not 4d or 5d or 11d or whatever: the bare minimums, and one of the things I want to do is to make a matte black version of ourselves, but because concept is a frequency, carbon (the stuff our body is made out of) can illuminate and swirl around, all with the power of what I call "conceptual programs". I have a lot of them, and a lot are available, and a lot are a secret (that not even I know about), but that doesn't matter, because I can only access the highest frequency ones (ie, desire -- which is a physical concept), so really only 3d (which is constantly changing), is a perfectly suitable place for something like desire. anyone who wants to follow me on that one, go for it (just desire it), right -- but I want to say it's kind of annoying constantly having to rediscover concepts all the time. it results in kinda bad memory (if the memory didn''t feel good) and a sort of forgetfulness/loftiness that will make you a little more childlike. it's really terrible, let me tell you. but anyway... that's the message. the medium is the message, but so is that one, from a higher perspective: don't desire the medium to give you what you want, instead I just desire that my own concepts are constantly outdated. they continue to update at like a really rapid rate, because I destroy even my best ideas intentionally. I hold on to no idea as something only I can experience; which is essentially what universal-perception is really all about. ... wow, that went a little too much salesman on that one; that's the problem with the medium: it informs the message/world-view. I sincerely hope that my unfortunate accident of selling an idea such as desire will be revered as anything but deplorable. I really do wish to provide a way for anyone to learn it for theirselves. (see what I mean? desire.)
  long intro. what the hell was I talking about? lol. right, the sumerians. this one gets nuts, so brace yourself.
  The sumerians talk about this past/future time of this world where it was organised differently where thoth is in 1st position (so he takes over for me) and then a weird set of 6 other beings following him, oops. I wrote it backwards; thoth is in 7th position when saturn-the-planet was in power. it talks about time when inana (in 1st position) was on top, but then she descended into the nether world right, and the planets are all way different than they are now, because jupiter destroyed the 5th planet, tiamtat right -- and so when that happened, planets past mars all fell down a slot energetically (they're probably in a more constrained position now, actually) and that caused thoth/mercury/paris to be thrown out of 3d: the fall of troy. now inana runs the show, and the whole planet is now "infested" with her genetics. she's queen of desire, and also every woman, and man but the difference is that men have a narative component to our genetics that describes what's wanted in symbolic form. I believe there's a replica copy of it inside of our brains, much like the one in middle of the solar system: issis. anyway that symbolic representation of desire is our primary source of attraction, until desire/attraction is experienced directly, which happens because both are working simultaneously (the symbolic and the desire; it's a medium I call relational, and the less symbolic representation they have, the more conceptual it is. the symbolic/narrative is the veil that one has to pierce through to be able to see the concept for what it *really* is: pure-desire.). anyway, that's earth, and we're all a part of it. it's an organism that lives forever. like all other planets (though they hide it with a shell) and stars out there, all live forever. science (thinking that stars are only finite), I must say is a direct reflection of our inability to be able to conceptualise something that can live *forever*.
  it's a crazy thing, but essentially what happens is that earth basically takes over, and so now a constantly growing number of things are becoming relative to the earth in more ways than just position (which is just a small part of the spectrum), and so that's when even the sun bows to inana/earth and everything now revolves around this ultra self-serving woman. the people around her perceived her, and she grew into bigger and bigger form until she caused an inversion, where the inside became so loud inside of itself, it popped (like ann egg) and the inside became the outside. we live on top of the centre of the universe -- and so what I believe is that myth is talking about how we/different people eventually perecieved someone that thinks they're the centre of the universe. total societal collapse. enter the aryans red (btw the sumerians were the aryans black, like hitler) and now we're all (or at least should be by now) children of desire, which means that we are also connected to that constantly increasing signal called desire. it causes all things to grow (and our resistance/dependence causes it to slow/stop) and it's in all things. it's that life essence, and I'd kinda like to imagine that the furthest we've gone down the rabbit hole is into what I'm calling the conceptual. it's fully possible to build a new interpretter for higher and higher frequencies. we are receptive beings, so why now just add on more wavelengths? why not cusxtomise it.
    it's a really tragic story though for any stone age culture, because they didn't notice anything different, but eventually desire is making those cultrus ssystems more and more obsolete to keep up with the new harmonics, and it turned into complete outrage and awfulness if that's what one was experincing, or the manifestation/realisation of one's greatestt/desire *or fear* (and usually both in the same body). all things collapsed because we essentially lived on the inside of the earth/egg and that is like the imagination. that imagination travels toward the inner sun, which means that originally we were built all as a reflection of the universe, and then when inana descended, then she essentially kicked thoth out of physical and became the new 3d. we essentially fell out of our symbolic inner-skull imagination and into the harsh 3d outer-skull reality that we're all "cast out" of the inner earth's glorious realms.
      the way that I imagine tmat it would be is after passing the inverse, from then on, you're going into more and more dense plasma as one approachs the inner core, which is basically like super duper ultra dense hydrogen. the blackest of black. however, we humans don't see the hydrogen, instead we see the imagination of that "time" (world-view). I don't have a pinecone, so I see 3d reality. that was necessary to get me into this weightless state of desire. I believe it's going to be possible to be impure-desire (that is, contaminated by the imagination), and we'll call those ones insects. I perfer however to be a plant. I don't care for the pinecone, and prefer to see things the way I want to see them (like a plant). I'm just another antennae/hair/plant on the surface of the earth, just like most everyone else. I probably live in the inner world of the earth, where there's a pretty good simulation of what's going on the surface. anyway, what I think is happening is that we're going to eventually POP, and the sides will flip. you all will enter into the underworld (where I'm at now), and I'll go into the outer. the universe is ours/mine for the taking. some people will interpret that all sorts of different ways and do all sorts of things, but I don't care, cause I'll prolly chill on earth for the rest of my life. there's so much crazy cool stuff here that it's not really much necessary (yet) for me to want to see other places yet (like who knows -- maybe a trip to mars for a day would be fun -- cause it prolly looks a whole lot like pueblo co (where I live on "earth")). anyway, I have no idea where I live, as that seems to be quite the coverup in my day and age, but I don't really have so much worry, because desire is always finding an improvement. only something like desire could live forever, until of course she gets bored and wants to do something else, duh. [break time, brb]

### 2023-10-10 16:21 - the second

hi robyn,
I thoroughly enjoyed writing parts of the last letter (some more than others). I do have to admit that it was a dramatic failure, as I'm sure this one, will be as well. that aside, I want to talk about some of the characters in an abstract form.
  mars exists because vulcan wants him to be there; he's a product of desire, and so therefore he can be seen as the masculine form of anatau (anu) in human flesh. he existed back in the time of the sumerians, and since then as well.
  the way the human body is formed (out of physical matter), we have a sort of "hardware" (physical) brain and a "software" (conceptual) brain. both exist simultanously, and though the hardware version can be boosted/diminished in its operation, the fact remains: adam/mars is only as good as the hardware brain allows him to be. it's a limiting form to remain in physical, because without it, the brain would be the size of the universe. so, to ensure it's only a discreet part of the universal mind in one physical brain place, then we have the soft-soft-ware (some of you know what I'm talking about) which is all of the symbolic ideas that our society is built up upon.
    you know there's this really hilarious play about it, where dumuzi is telling his wife this extremely symbolically graphic dream he had about losing his penis and dying. so his wife, ereshkigal is so well versed in all of the proper syntax of behaviour established in the culture, she says, "OH NO, I'll go and tell everyone that you're going to lose your penis and die, and so anticipating his imenent death, she goes to mourn for him (cause that's what you're supposed to do). for her, it's very logical.
    however, for dumuzi, the symbolic aspect of the dream are terribly ominious (that's a mouthful). he's really quite upset, especially because when he asked her what she thought of it, she made it WAY WORSE (lol). anyway, so this is the guy and gal that have been put in charge of the earth. they're like tweedle-dee and tweedle-dumm, because they are only apable of seeing the symbolic aspect of reality, and so venus/ereshkigal (-3) can only see the pure symbolic system of how humans are supposed to interact. this kind of stuff was programmed by thoth into our DNA/ME originally on, and it served (before the invention of the X) as the original way for physical beings to interact. before we were conscious, we were like robots or insects, just kinda battling it oout and doing our own thing. different species were more successful than others, and what we know as human now came about as a series of long evolutions (if you believe in the glacial theory, but I'm more of a stoned ape/enkidu thinker myself, because I'm very clearly an enkidu in my own narrative). anyway, the symbolic way we encounter reality is entirely neutral, and so the pure-symbolic way is like ereshkigal. she's completely naive to the different symbols that the enkidu have put around these symbols appearing in his dream and so she's clueless. in this play, she represents tthe maiden. in other plays, she's the mother (and all the problems of being a naive mother), and she's the hag. this is the part of her life that dumuzi really fears the most, but it's all his own doing, and so she just sorta helps him along to get the things he wants (and also doesn't want).
      their interaction was hilarious to the sumerians, and they made a lot of different plays about them. there were other triads as well, including the moon which I haven't figured out yet, (though I got the book you recommended about the moon) -- I'd like to tell you what seems pretty obvious to me: it serves as the down transformer of solar energy into astral components, the midpoint (spectral), is where earth is inverting in it's shell (middle-earth?). so essentially it regulates everything down all the way to physical earth: air. which is pretty strongly tied to water (and how it flows). the egyptians knew about this, and used it to create magnificient things. water though would be the lower end of the spectrum though, because it gets to very very tiny vibrations at some point. I think the sumerians may have also known something like this as well, but I think the shrouded the whole thing in a big semen joke, only to hide the true quality of knowing how water flows, can create a new mental reality of any design. they created and narrated a lot of things, and so they just had all the mars they needed, and prostitutes of any kind they wanted; a veritable paradise (a walled garden of their own creation).
        you ever notice how you've sorta writtin yourself into a corner, there's this problem because eventually the thing that you're writing, shows up and starts to take on reality? well, I don't want to do that just yet, but eventually it becomes inevitable, and so essentially I want to keep writing, and keep writing because I want to keep getting better understanding and lower resistance, cause it's like not really all that hard, and there's basically infinity to do it in, so who cares what ends up happening, just let the narrative play out, right -- so it's kinda my idea to just let everyone else just start writing their own narrative, and then we'll all go into thoths' new matrix where they'll take over 1st position. we'll learn and grow and discover within the parameters that we're given. they'll rule us from the "inner" earth, where they're all living the reality that they want/imagine/desire/fear it to be, and that'll have an effect on us, for sure -- in fact the whole entire universe will eventually have an effect on us, but that's the fun of it.
        we'll essentially get the command from "God" (saturn/dumuzi) telling us we're ready to go "conquer" the great universe. we'll probably have to start with our galaxy at first, but me personally, I'll probably just chill out here, where reality happens nicely. we'll be like the israelites, but for the whole universe. go and conquer it all; and they will, I'm sure.
        what I'm saying in all of this, is that eventually even the most grotesque/grizzly narratives that can be thought up, have a sort wanted/positive side to them that's actually pretty cool, and so all that needs to be done when in this situation is just hang on and know that eventually it happens, but not until ...
          I like to think of this idea sexually. if I'm ready to go, then I know that desire can always carry me to the end, and she'll actually be the first to go, triggering/attracting me to join her.
          so, when applying this idea to narrative, no matter how many narratives pass by, there will always be a better one, and so it's fun to just keep getting a better narrative reality. that's the 2nd ray perspective, which is the same as the sun. she/issis loves technology, and and that's what we use to continually write better narratives. technology makes new ways possible to tell a new narrative, and she loves that. I perceive from earth's perspective though, which is monopolar (just me), so a narrative is essentially impossible for me to do. I can do it in my brain (which is, (like the sun) a 2nd ray device), and so I can construct narratives in my brain and work out symbolic stuff from the perspective of pure-desire (what I'm doing now), but what I'm still only capable of being the a lens into the collective total of all human desire through a fairly non-resistant (brain) perception. I've made a lot of decisions about how to symbolically react in certain situations, so in that way I'm a solar robot -- a mix of the earth (7) and the star (2,1) in symbolic body, which is only capable of seeing through the brains' symbolic lens mixed with my understanding of pure-desire (in symbolic form).
          the way that these ideas "battle" each other during sex is always a destructive thing, because it creates an awful lot of vibrational collisions, which is just more desire. so what is actually desired is that the ideas take a time to get ready (not unlike waiting for marriage), until the opposite pairs are harmonious to each other, so that the result is harmonious. I don't want that, or the alternative either which is making a bunch of (out of control unwanted/wanted) desire without any intention. it makes a big mess from my experience,  so my prefererred method is neither of those two, but to instead create (?) stability out of instablity, and create (?) stability out of diversity. this instead will allow all sorts of expansion of the human mind, and it'll probably all happen in a matrix as well, that way we can leave dumuzi in charge.
          for the sumerians, the myth happening in the past or the future was irrelevant, so everyone in 3d, prepare to meet your wildest fantasy/feared reality come to pass (some of them will control us as well), and I/we will go outward. so to prevent us from (really) going/looking outward (there are always these consttraints on me), we'll get put into a matrix (if not already, soon) so that they can run the physical world where all of our celestial bodies reside (upon which I'm sure many species will be put: reflections of them, and they'll intermingle and stuff -- with this BS (star-wars-like) technology, that doesn't actually do anything universally devastating), and many people will take on many forms. it'll be really cool, but for me, they prolly want to put me into a matrix. I don't really mind, as it's not that big of a deal for me (I'm already in how many? -- and you know why there are no "aliens" here? they don't need to be. they're here already looking through or joining us). so anyway, there's no need to worry about anything, because even if they really blow it, then it's no big deal. they have the tech to be able to get me into another body, so I'm sure they'll be fine. something goes wrong, just call the guy. no big deal.
(corner-writing)
      let's start again at the sumerians living in a veritable paradise where they've got all the mars/gilgamesh that they can handle, so in one of the plays, it was decided that mars would choose to be a real asshole, and be like the village jerk, going around taking all of the virgin girls virginity and just establishing himself as a sort of figure for masculinity. it was a tragedy I figure, because mars wasn't like that at first. he would have always been (in their society) the reflection of vulcans' desire. mars (as an individual) has to continue to strive to be what the vulcans (male or female) want them to be like. a lot of mothers are vulcans as well, and so they grow their kid up to be the narrative idea of what they think they want, without really even realising it. the problem is, that the tragedy here is that gilgamesh's mother wants a real hotshot/hotspur, a guy with an action plan, top amongst the ladies and best guy ever. reality is, though, she'll never get what she wants for her boy though because he grows up in society, and that society is usually pretty sexist, and relies a lot on conquering, conquest, and competition to be the more identifying masculine traits. anu is nothing like mars. anu is everything desirable in a man, and mars is all of the macho tropes rolled into one, growing up in a really self-aware society (just like me and, I figure prolly everyone on earth)
      this paradise was their own, and they had so much fun living in their own astral worlds of narrative (powered by the moon), they eventually wrote themselves "down" (from their perspective) into physical reality. paradise lost. their own walled garden crumbled under their own narrative, as the stories that these play-rights and poets wrote, came to pass (though not in the intended way), because this is physical reality, and thoth's secret sauce (ea) wasn't a full carry; so things manifested not as *intended*, but as *desired*. that sent us on a quest to figure out what it is that actually makes things work as intended. what is desire? someone has to figure it out eventually right? cause (being physical beings) we (mars) want things *to work as intended*, so we figure it out, or manipulate it, destroy it, whatever. the world is just a place to experiment, learn and do things.

actually, it wasn't that bad. bye for now.

### 2023-10-11 14:51 - thoughts on titus

after writing the above, yesterday I went and read the [entire wikipedia page on titus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus), and by now I'm pretty close to 100% convinced he's the guy that wrote mark. the main reason for that is that [apollonius predicted his death to the sea, and supposedly a sea-hare was used to poison him](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165942/http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_31.html#%A732). the strange thing about that passage is that he's predicted to die in a similar manner to odyssyus. (sorry I'm so bad at spelling) -- which is the same guy (mars).
  what I've noticed with these mars types is that they fall victim to belief in things outside of themselves. I refer to my own life as an example -- and since it's very unlikely that I'll ever actually send any of these, I'll be as candid and presumptuous as possible. dudly-do-right is the same as titus, socrates, and the fictional odysseus, in that they ultimately succomb to their own output -- so for example, you'll notice that dudly dies essentially because of propaganda, when the stuff he was doing with tthe plays and shakespere were all 100% tudor propaganda -- so when his wife dies to very suspicious circumstances (I think cecil had her killed), he was deprived of his position of power (marrying elizabeth). anyway cecil shows up in titus' story as well as his brother domitian, which ultimately takes over as emperor. in the story of socrates, it's pretty easy to see that he went around telling everyone to be warned about rhetoric and the ability to drum up emotion around a false idea that is baseless and fuled by emotion, which is also the story of how he died. I understand these mars types, as I'm very similar to them myself.
  I'd like to continue and point out that titus had two wives which I can positively identify as being extremely similar to the two past girlfriends in my own life, as well. arrecina is a woman that I will liken to be very similar to ereshkigal (-3), or the planet venus (consort of saturn/dumuzi). she's very logical and structured, and reminds me a lot of patricia. the thing is that her symbolic way of working things out has always to do with physical data and actions and stuff like that, taking very little into account about belief and desire. she died, and wikipedia doesn't give a reason, but I can explain it in the context of patricia what happened: titus blew her world-view out of shape. she's also similar to my mom in that she has a very strong opinion about how certain things works like finance, politics, and things like that -- things that work well, but desire and belief are much more powerful than that. almost certainly at that time her very closed ideas about how things work were repugnant to titus, and he starts to find out more about how things relate one to another, instaed of just their function/action (in a pure environment).. so, she dies or leaves the scene pretty rapidly (just like patricia) and in comes marcia (-2), same as raquel -- and she's well-connected and has a unique insight into relationships and seeing that there are other people than myself (just like how raquel opened my eyes to the reality that there are more people in the world than just me).
  anyway the first one (arrecina) bore him a daughter (julia) who was probably pretty similar to her mom, encoding a lot of the financial and political structure into her, which his brother domitian (+2) would then come to really like. titus offered her to him  in marriage but he rejected, probably because he was looking to this other woman to be his way in to power and money.
    domitian is a lot like my brother greg, btw, and it's interesting because his mint coins have on the other side of him a phoenix bird. well, if you look at the cylendar seal, you'll notice that just below inana is a guy with a knife trying to kill her in 2nd position (looking up), and looking down is the phoenix bird (this is the symbolic archetype).
  you see, what's happening here is that titus is beginning to learn to see things from a 1st ray perspective (one of desire), and so his second wife (like raquel was for me), was important to being able to see how desire connects to belief through expectation. it is, also pretty likely that titus was capable of seeing pictures in his eyes and had open-eye visions/visuals regularly (same with dudly and socrates) -- and so for a guy like that, how does he communicate that interal vision outward so that others are convinced of the same thing, and are capable of seeing the same vision (hamlet is the story of this going all wrong). well, the way to do it is to get people to *believe* something through a narrative (pretty similar to how I'm doing now, but I'm more using my life as an example than my speculation on titus).
    the reason why I explained the visions thing is because I must first interject a theory that I have, which is that there were two separate timelines: one where jesus (the egyptian) was on the earth ~1kya, and there was another timeline where a bunch of vulcans experienced an alternate/imagined (and highly stylised) version of that same history.
      as an example, imagine that there are a bunch of crazy things that almost happened in my life, and so let's say that one of them is that these young girls are really into me -- and while I personally have not really had much interaction with any young girls ever, nevertheless, I have had a lot of visions/dreams of let's say "alternate timelines" where others were/are with these girls. I experience them in a sort of 1.5st person perspective. I know they're not me, but it happens the same, as if it were me (though I don't really feel or see anything).
    I believe the same thing is happening to titus here, and he's actually experiencing a lot of vulcan narrative retelling/experiencing of events from a future mars (the egyptian) around 1000ad. when these vision/dream sequences happen to me, suddenly I'm here doing this thing, and then suddenly I'm somewhere else doing another thing -- and AFAICT this is all happening in the astral realm, and so really all of these things reported are not what actually happened but vulcans' narrative desire played out through these characters. it's interesting thing to note the naked boy wearing only a skimpy wrap, and a bunch of other extremely homoerotic stuff happening, as well.
      what really is happening here, I'm not totally sure, but my opinion is that these guys are actors, and they see something that I do, and they say -- "wow that line could have been better" or "maybe if he touched her here, things would have gone nicer" -- stuff like that, and so they replay the same situation and take it further and in a different direction than it originally went (ie, toward what they desire).
    and so all that's really happening here is that during that time solar energy had to have been very strong (a number of really big fires), so there's probably a strong blending between astral and physical -- and so people probaby *did* see the risen christ -- even though that event wasn't going to take place for another 1ky (a solar cycle), it was as if it was happening now. all titus did is take the circumstances at that time (notice how titus/mars/socrates/dudly all show up at times of extreme heat/solar activity) and write a narrative *prophesying* the destruction of the temple (something he planned to do next year, because it would be proper to wait until he's 30 to accomplish the big feat). he, like me, proved himself (and his predictions) right.
      I have a lot of loose predictions (loose cause they're pretty conditional and I make it clear that they're extrapolations, not prophecy/predictions), and so I'm highly aware of how other people's belief in what I'm saying affects not only what I write next, but also our trajectory into the future. I don't intend for my predictions to come to pass, but you have to understand this all from his perspective. his first wife (patricia) explained to him that his (calculated) desire is to gain power and gain more influence in roman society. this is fine and everything, but ultimately it's a relational thing (who you know), that matters -- and so he accomplished her calculated desire for him, but not the way she would have wanted it to go -- instead he did it brutally and very violently by using the power of desire/fear linked with belief/expectation. he's brilliant at manipulating his troops to get his desire (some call that good leadership), but I think when he got to the throne, he realised pretty quickly that it wasn't what he really wanted. he likes doing things for people and is very generous/charitable, but it's not necessary to use force to get there.
        this is quite similar to what would have happened to me with patricia because I realised pretty quickly that learning german would have caused me to become very aggressive and militaristic in my approach to what I want, so I figured (for now at least), just spanish and english is fine (as one day I hope to design my own language with extra features that english is lacking and I find cumbersome). because we just started a relationship together, patricia wanted me to learn german so that we could integrate into the living in berlin -- but I didn't want to try and make my desire happen by doing all of the systematically obvious steps to get there (like she wanted). I had to release myself from her symbolic 3rd ray perception and continue onward toward desire.
    wikipedia doesn't say why arrecina/patricia died, but I know that if patricia had've kept having sex with me, it would have been very bad for her because all of her societally correct ways of doing things, just weren't working at all for her anymore. I seemingly broke the rules and didn't need to do all of the expected things to get the thing. it's a terrible mental dissonance when society says that good things get rewarded to people who earn them, and then a guy like me comes along and gets good things without earning it. it felt to me like her world-view was collapsing, and she didn't know how to reason about how the world works (this is the same as my mom too when she doesn't understand that I just want -- and that's it -- it just starts coming). I'm sure that mental dissonance eventually accumulated to such an extent that she destroyed herself with her own attraction (she needs to prove that one has to earn it, and so things will get more and more difficult for her meanwhile she's trying to prove herself and her world-view as right). because arrecina (-3) wasn't able to perceive desire marcia (-2) didn't have to work at all for titus' affection at all and just fell right into his arms. she proved herself wrong (because she probably had to work hard for him).
  the other one he had an affair with bernice (11y older than him) is also a very interesting relationship, and she's most certainly got the symbol of the whore of babylon. she's positively 7th ray in perception (just physical), and it's pretty likely that they used sex to build up the desire/chaos that would eve ntually allow him to take over the temple. she's highly physical and pretty good at manipulating politics (being with her brother agrippa -- who was prolly pretty vulcan-like), so she was the same as arrecina in that way, but being *only* focused on the physicality of now, desire is much easier to happen, because there isn't so much process/structure it has to go through before becoming reality (like with arrecina).
the most interesting thing around him actually is his brother, because he'd be the opposite (only emitter, instead of recceiver/emitter) of marcia, and so it's almost as if titus wanted his brother to be able to do well as an emperor of rome, so he left his daughter (julia) for him to have -- and she likely stabilised a lot of things -- because he was too worried about who he's connected to that gives him power (because he doesn't see himself as good, alwasy living in the shadow of his brother titus). with someone to give him power (titus' daughter), he feels capable of doing something, but he's ultimately going to destroy himself with his own emphasis of relying on others capability, rathar than building his own (again, very similar to my brother/prometheus/alalu).
