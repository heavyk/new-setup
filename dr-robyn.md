hi, I thought to message you ever single myth-vision video that I saw, but I don't really know what I want to say. so, I'm just going to write. I'll start off with an explanation of my version of "history" (and how time works), and then follow it up with some thoughts on "who wrote the gospels".

I could never be a classical "historian" in the traditional sense, simply because I believe that every timeline which arrives to the present to be a valid one. most of "history" has been a fight over which narrative is the "right" one -- and anyone who doesn't believe the same way as we (some culture group with an origin story) do, should be exterminated, so that the whole entire planet can live in harmony, and believe the same thing. as such, we try to get everyone on earth "on the same page", and so the various narratives that exist are an effort to try and bring every human being on earth into the same global imagination of how the "past" was.
  to understand what I mean by this, let us imagine an imaginary or astral earth, which is not at all unlike how our own builds a world-view of something: a global concept of how everything fits together. multiple world-views exist on this planet, and there are as many of them as there are conscious human beings. we might imagine each one of these world-views as a sort of point (of light, like a star) in a sort of cloud: some world-views are closer to others than others -- and so you may have millions in the islam grouping, and a bunch in the big christian grouping, but upon looking closer, there are a number of different minor groupings as well corresponding to different denominations, orthodox, and minor sects, all the way down to small groupings of cults and things like that.
  each one of these world-views has a different version of how "history" is formed, with nobody having a complete picture of it all. some historians and academics align themselves more to one grouping of world-views than another, but it must be understood that all of these groups have massive "blind spots" where aspects have not been considered or cannot be known with our present level of technology
    which, I do believe that time machines do exist, however a time traveler can go to *any time* (even one that academics would call a ficticious one) -- as long as the tim5 corresponds with the rest of the beliefs in the travelers' world-views: so like gravity has to work, and the sun has to be there and, precipitation cycle is pretty much the same; all the important stuff. as such, time machines are not actually used to explore the "past" -- because *anything* is possible, but instead used to adjust our trajectory into the future (which is just a (symbolic) world-view grouping extrapolated into the future) -- because everyone experiencing that alternate past *believes* it, and so when they return to the "present" (they never left the present), they *believe* that to be the past, and so their world-view has been updated to reflect that, which then through intercourse of ideas, other world-views get updated as well. (I say "updated" but all of these points are in motion, again, a lot like stars)
  therefore, I'm not going to try and conclusively sell you or anyone else on any form of history (in science terms, I'm saying I don't offer a comprehensive 4d schema/trajectory; instead, I offer the 5d perspective).

now, when I suggest the ideas in the following bits about "who wrote the gospels", consider that I'm drawing a lot off of a [centre-place lecture of the same name](https://youtu.be/BT12rsfvnhI) which I watched last night, and today youtube suggested me to watch [your myth-vision video](https://youtu.be/uINo-f7xG9g) of the same title, as well about an hour ago. I also want to be clear that this idea came to me only last night after watching that video.
essentially the idea goes to me like this: mark sounds like a guy like me that's writing. I often times misquote things because I've stored the concept in my brain of what the text says in that section, and so when I retrieve it, I translate the concept back into english or spanish (are my only two options right now). I can also turn the idea into flow-charts and timelines too, so it doesn't have to only natural language as its output. I often times translate words and ideas into mental art and pictures (which I don't "see" with my eyes -- but they exist internally -- much like the world-views)
  in fact there's a lot of similarity between the world-views perspective to history and what I call "conceptual perception", as one of my concepts (which is all a world-view really is) can easily be compared with another concept, and bigger concepts -- and some more abstract, sorta like how I can "feel" (or things "sound") to me like a thing/narrative I heard somewhere else. I can compare my concepts/world-views to others concepts/world-views with ease (though none of them have names -- just feelings) and the result is a feeling (which I experience as a giant picture) of how the world works. in fact, I am doing that right this very moment while writing to you, as I look at the same thing/concept/world-view from a slightly different angle and write another sentence. I've learned enough knowledge and paid enough attention to how to formulate sentences, and each sentence formulation has a "feel" to it. some sentences feel or "sound" better than others. (shakespere is a study into how to make certain ideas "sound" really awesome, so he too has the ability to feel how a sentence "sounds" (not with ears)).
as I was watching the centre-place lecture the author of mark sounded vvery roman to me. in fact, he sounded to me like being specifically from the flavain dynasty. the idea that came to me is that this gospel was probably written in 69 as a sort of self-prophesying *proof* that such a thing would happen -- because it was either be someone that titus hired to write, or titus himself that wrote it. I believe the latter, and I'll take the next section to "prove" it before moving on to the other three.
  I must noww introduce the concept of the triad, and this is an extremely noticeable triad in most all of modern literatere. the three players are mars, vulcan, and venus/aphrodite. the woman is the most interesting, because she is earth; a shapeshifter taking on the form of (almost?) every human being on the planet. she is gaia, the shapeshifter, the puma, the black condor, owl, dove, venus, aphrodite,... I personally find her the most remarkable of them because of her role as ishtar/inana in the sumerian civilisation (who were mostly a bunch of vulcan/enkidu and mars types + (prostitutes?)). in the book of revelation, she's "the great whore", but she's the same inana that descends into the underworld.
    OK, I really need to pause a moment and go over some sumerian mythology: the first world-view -- until a bunch of try-hards tried to turn it into what they think it should be: us, the aryans :) well, OK, I'm trying to be too salacious here...
    inana/aphrodite is who I will call earth which I'll call "7th ray or physical perception"; and that's where the star on the inside of the earth's spherical resonator slows down pretty rapidly (our atmosphere is only a few hundred km tall) to zero, and then inverts itself (very much like the skull of the head -- notice the iconography). there is an inner earth just like there is an inner skull, where our imagination resides (where these world-views/concepts get manifest into visual/imaginary/astral). the planet is the same, also having an outer-skull area where everything else *outside* of "self" is *percieved*, and all of the inner-skull stuff is *real* (or is it the other way around?).
    mars is the masculine version of that. our bodies are receptive beings: we receive all sorts of signals which then a bunch gets filtered out and transformed into a physical/visceral (happening in the body) sensation. mars has a narrative big-picture of how all of those signals/symbols fit together; an internal world-view. I equate the this narrative structure to the Y chromosome.
    vulcan well, remember how our bodies are receptive beings? each of those receptions have a mental representation as well as physical; so, just as each neuron has a whatever vultage in relation to another, so too do these relations exist with the world-view of the person on the mental plane (the one that astral/imaginary is made of). so he's exactly like mars in that he has a symbolic representation of something encoded within a matrix of relations between concepts/ideas/world-views. I also equate him with the Y chromosome.
    those three characters (mars|aphrodite|vulcan) exist in essentially every mythology available to us in cOncept.
    for the sumerians, this was gilgamesh (mars), enkidu (vulcan), the prostitute (brb)
