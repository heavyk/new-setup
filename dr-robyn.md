hi, I thought to message you ever single myth-vision video that I saw, but I don't really know what I want to say. so, I'm just going to write. I'll start off with an explanation of my version of "history" (and how time works), and then follow it up with some thoughts on "who wrote the gospels".

I could never be a classical "historian" in the traditional sense, simply because I believe that every timeline which arrives to the present to be a valid one. most of "history" has been a fight over which narrative is the "right" one -- and anyone who doesn't believe the same way as we (some culture group with an origin story) do, should be exterminated, so that the whole entire planet can live in harmony, and believe the same thing. as such, we try to get everyone on earth "on the same page", and so the various narratives that exist are an effort to try and bring every human being on earth into the same global imagination of how the "past" was.
  to understand what I mean by this, let us imagine an imaginary or astral earth, which is not at all unlike how our own builds a world-view of something: a global concept of how everything fits together. multiple world-views exist on this planet, and there are as many of them as there are conscious human beings. we might imagine each one of these world-views as a sort of point (of light, like a star) in a sort of cloud: some world-views are closer to others than others -- and so you may have millions in the islam grouping, and a bunch in the big christian grouping, but upon looking closer, there are a number of different minor groupings as well corresponding to different denominations, orthodox, and minor sects, all the way down to small groupings of cults and things like that.
  each one of these world-views has a different version of how "history" is formed, with nobody having a complete picture of it all. some historians and academics align themselves more to one grouping of world-views than another, but it must be understood that all of these groups have massive "blind spots" where aspects have not been considered or cannot be known with our present level of technology
    which, I do believe that time machines do exist, however a time traveler can go to *any time* (even one that academics would call a ficticious one) -- as long as the tim5 corresponds with the rest of the beliefs in the travelers' world-views: so like gravity has to work, and the sun has to be there and, precipitation cycle is pretty much the same; all the important stuff. as such, time machines are not actually used to explore the "past" -- because *anything* is possible, but instead used to adjust our trajectory into the future (which is just a (symbolic) world-view grouping extrapolated into the future) -- because everyone experiencing that alternate past *believes* it, and so when they return to the "present" (they never left the present), they *believe* that to be the past, and so their world-view has been updated to reflect that, which then through intercourse of ideas, other world-views get updated as well. (I say "updated" but all of these points are in motion, again, a lot like stars)
  therefore, I'm not going to try and conclusively sell you or anyone else on any form of history (in science terms, I'm saying I don't offer a comprehensive 4d schema/trajectory; instead, I offer the 5d perspective).

now, when I suggest the ideas in the following bits about "who wrote the gospels", consider that I'm drawing a lot off of a [centre-place lecture of the same name](https://youtu.be/BT12rsfvnhI) which I watched last night, and today youtube suggested me to watch [your myth-vision video](https://youtu.be/uINo-f7xG9g) of the same title, as well about an hour ago. I also want to be clear that this idea came to me only last night after watching that video.
essentially the idea goes to me like this: mark sounds like a guy like me that's writing. I often times misquote things because I've stored the concept in my brain of what the text says in that section, and so when I retrieve it, I translate the concept back into english or spanish (are my only two options right now). I can also turn the idea into flow-charts and timelines too, so it doesn't have to only natural language as its output. I often times translate words and ideas into mental art and pictures (which I don't "see" with my eyes -- but they exist internally -- much like the world-views)
  in fact there's a lot of similarity between the world-views perspective to history and what I call "conceptual perception", as one of my concepts (which is all a world-view really is) can easily be compared with another concept, and bigger concepts -- and some more abstract, sorta like how I can "feel" (or things "sound") to me like a thing/narrative I heard somewhere else. I can compare my concepts/world-views to others concepts/world-views with ease (though none of them have names -- just feelings) and the result is a feeling (which I experience as a giant picture) of how the world works. in fact, I am doing that right this very moment while writing to you, as I look at the same thing/concept/world-view from a slightly different angle and write another sentence. I've learned enough knowledge and paid enough attention to how to formulate sentences, and each sentence formulation has a "feel" to it. some sentences feel or "sound" better than others. (shakespere is a study into how to make certain ideas "sound" really awesome, so he too has the ability to feel how a sentence "sounds" (not with ears)).
as I was watching the centre-place lecture the author of mark sounded vvery roman to me. in fact, he sounded to me like being specifically from the flavain dynasty. the idea that came to me is that this gospel was probably written in 69 as a sort of self-prophesying *proof* that such a thing would happen -- because it was either be someone that titus hired to write, or titus himself that wrote it. I believe the latter, and I'll take the next section to "prove" it before moving on to the other three.
  I must noww introduce the concept of the triad, and this is an extremely noticeable triad in most all of modern literatere. the three players are mars, vulcan, and venus/aphrodite. the woman is the most interesting, because she is earth; a shapeshifter taking on the form of (almost?) every human being on the planet. she is gaia, the shapeshifter, the puma, the black condor, owl, dove, venus, aphrodite,... I personally find her the most remarkable of them because of her role as ishtar/inana in the sumerian civilisation (who were mostly a bunch of vulcan/enkidu and mars types + (prostitutes?)). in the book of revelation, she's "the great whore", but she's the same inana that descends into the underworld.
    OK, I really need to pause a moment and go over some sumerian mythology: the first world-view -- until a bunch of try-hards tried to turn it into what they think it should be: us, the aryans :) well, OK, I'm trying to be too salacious here...
    inana/aphrodite is who I will call earth which I'll call "7th ray or physical perception"; and that's where the star on the inside of the earth's spherical resonator slows down pretty rapidly (our atmosphere is only a few hundred km tall) to zero, and then inverts itself (very much like the skull of the head -- notice the iconography). there is an inner earth just like there is an inner skull, where our imagination resides (where these world-views/concepts get manifest into visual/imaginary/astral). the planet is the same, also having an outer-skull area where everything else *outside* of "self" is *percieved*, and all of the inner-skull stuff is *real* (or is it the other way around?).
    mars is the masculine version of that. our bodies are receptive beings: we receive all sorts of signals which then a bunch gets filtered out and transformed into a physical/visceral (happening in the body) sensation. mars has a narrative big-picture of how all of those signals/symbols fit together; an internal world-view. I equate the this narrative structure to the Y chromosome.
    vulcan well, remember how our bodies are receptive beings? each of those receptions have a mental representation as well as physical; so, just as each neuron has a whatever vultage in relation to another, so too do these relations exist with the world-view of the person on the mental plane (the one that astral/imaginary is made of). so he's exactly like mars in that he has a symbolic representation of something encoded within a matrix of relations between concepts/ideas/world-views. I also equate him with the Y chromosome.
    those three characters (mars|aphrodite|vulcan) exist in essentially every mythology available to us in cOncept.
    for the sumerians, this was gilgamesh (mars), enkidu (vulcan), the prostitute (brb 03:12)

    (if I may interject a moment here a brief commentary on what it's like publishing my thoughts so regularly: every publish causes a complete abortion of the idea/concept for me, and when I go back to the idea I once had (before publish) is actually gone; I can't access it anymore. it's changed so much that it's unrecognisable to me; but then, I just learn a new way to see the idea before I published it. for most people, the abortion of an idea like that is often devastating, and for mee it was a lot as well. I eventually got pretty good at finding the new concept, because it's pretty easy: the better version of the concept feels better than the previous one. I sort of do all of this on purpose, because it shows that my concepts are constantly updating, even if the text on it dates itself pretty quickly. what I then do, is I simply repeat/relate the same concepts in newer more complex ways all of the time. the mental expansion that I receive from doing it is insane. many podcasters and the like know that mental expansxionn happens prretty rapidly, once I start telling my thoughts out loud (or trying to render them as best/clear as possible), what ends up happening is that because I'm constantly updating the text of the concept, to kind of render the concept in a more expansive way)
    (if I may continue, as we'll soon see, further down in the thesis, I need to find a technology or some capacity to allow others to esssentially "undo" my teachings on the idea, and learn it their own way. this is essentially the technology that is desired, which is that for novelty to turn into diversity (until more novelty is desired). I'll explain more later -- however what's (I think is) really happening here is that my conceptual world is growing at a magnificent rate, and more and more things will depend on me, and treat me like they treat earth: exploit my body. it's normal right? for me it is, and so that kinda makes me the universe (ie, soemone who lives forever, because of such monumental desire for my existence for longer than a single lifetime can imagine: the product of a corporation -- something that lives for a long time, and strongly depends on me). you know, as I was thinking earlier, one of the cool things I'd like to do is to make it possible for everyone to be able to (once/as we all become weightless) reduce different conceptual resistances (conceptual changes to their form), so for example they could "upgrade" their patience to a higher level (the details are kinda gorey, which is that I don't know technolgically how anyone could do it the "easy" way, but I'm sure some will figure it out -- I just make a desire which is like a really complex high-frequency vibration -- I dunno, with how I feel or perhaps "know" it could feel (like) -- and anyway that complex wave attracts the desired signal -- so my rememberance/memory of that desire is always in the old (recognised) form, so I just have to find the better feeling concept/recognition of the old form --- so I go bouncing higher and higher all the time, cause I like to :) and it's fun.) anyway, where was I? OH YES)

  before I continue, I just want to say that this is *my* (very not final version) of sumerian mythology, from which I've based this "understanding" that I have of it. I don't really have any thing to say what I've got is the *final* answer in any way. what I have is a working intuition of how things are. the main property of 3d earth, is that everything is constantly in a flux of change. I model my work on that concept, that everything I write, and I'd admit that it's going per- word/concept where it suddenly gets "outdated" on me. often times as a pastime, I go in to check in on some of these concepts, after they've been reacted to; because, here's the deal: I think I have the best most comprehensive world-view out there at the moment, but there's no stopping anyone else from having the same realisation. that's the moment of enlightenment: it's OK to be different/better/awesomemore than evveryone else. + want to display that it's possible to manipulate the conceptual world with one's perception of an idea. the perception is really a 2nd ray (relational) thing that exists not only in the conceptual, but also in the physical brain. the combination of these two signals is very high frequency, so it's basically invisible. I'm fairly certain that I get mine hijacked all the time, and I don't know if it's my own code/cconcepts that are making these things appear or not (I'm a pretty creative person) so it's likely my (I would suppose) own doing. nevermind that. the result is I'm constantling having to find a higher and higher frequency (ie, lower and lower resistance) which is the definition of desire pretty much; that attribute alone, convinces me that I/kenny have lowered my resistance to enough concepts that I've become quite flexible in space and time. everyone can do it. I claim that we all have the earth in us, and we're literally the only ones that are holding us back from that spanning space and perception because of our own resistance: I have to be this to this person; that to another person; this way at church, and that way at school. (sorry to get preachy. I think I was channeling you a bit there. anyway) and so what we end up here is everyone fitting into that conceptual percception through symbol and myth. symbol and myth are all the building blocks that one needs to create an artificial reality. each of these symbolic structures eventually breaks because it's no longer useful -- or rather I should say no longer desired. desire is constantly going higher and higher frequency, and so it's never able to stop. the only place that desire can manifest is into a fully *3d* body. not 4d or 5d or 11d or whatever: the bare minimums, and one of the things I want to do is to make a matte black version of ourselves, but because concept is a frequency, carbon (the stuff our body is made out of) can illuminate and swirl around, all with the power of what I call "conceptual programs". I have a lot of them, and a lot are available, and a lot are a secret (that not even I know about), but that doesn't matter, because I can only access the highest frequency ones (ie, desire -- which is a physical concept), so really only 3d (which is constantly changing), is a perfectly suitable place for something like desire. anyone who wants to follow me on that one, go for it (just desire it), right -- but I want to say it's kind of annoying constantly having to rediscover concepts all the time. it results in kinda bad memory (if the memory didn''t feel good) and a sort of forgetfulness/loftiness that will make you a little more childlike. it's really terrible, let me tell you. but anyway... that's the message. the medium is the message, but so is that one, from a higher perspective: don't desire the medium to give you what you want, instead I just desire that my own concepts are constantly outdated. they continue to update at like a really rapid rate, because I destroy even my best ideas intentionally. I hold on to no idea as something only I can experience; which is essentially what universal-perception is really all about. ... wow, that went a little too much salesman on that one; that's the problem with the medium: it informs the message/world-view. I sincerely hope that my unfortunate accident of selling an idea such as desire will be revered as anything but deplorable. I really do wish to provide a way for anyone to learn it for theirselves. (see what I mean? desire.)
  long intro. what the hell was I talking about? lol. right, the sumerians. this one gets nuts, so brace yourself.
  The sumerians talk about this past/future time of this world where it was organised differently where thoth is in 1st position (so he takes over for me) and then a weird set of 6 other beings following him, oops. I wrote it backwards; thoth is in 7th position when saturn-the-planet was in power. it talks about time when inana (in 1st position) was on top, but then she descended into the nether world right, and the planets are all way different than they are now, because jupiter destroyed the 5th planet, tiamtat right -- and so when that happened, planets past mars all fell down a slot energetically (they're probably in a more constrained position now, actually) and that caused thoth/mercury/paris to be thrown out of 3d: the fall of troy. now inana runs the show, and the whole planet is now "infested" with her genetics. she's queen of desire, and also every woman, and man but the difference is that men have a narative component to our genetics that describes what's wanted in symbolic form. I believe there's a replica copy of it inside of our brains, much like the one in middle of the solar system: issis. anyway that symbolic representation of desire is our primary source of attraction, until desire/attraction is experienced directly, which happens because both are working simultaneously (the symbolic and the desire; it's a medium I call relational, and the less symbolic representation they have, the more conceptual it is. the symbolic/narrative is the veil that one has to pierce through to be able to see the concept for what it *really* is: pure-desire.). anyway, that's earth, and we're all a part of it. it's an organism that lives forever. like all other planets (though they hide it with a shell) and stars out there, all live forever. science (thinking that stars are only finite), I must say is a direct reflection of our inability to be able to conceptualise something that can live *forever*.
  it's a crazy thing, but essentially what happens is that earth basically takes over, and so now a constantly growing number of things are becoming relative to the earth in more ways than just position (which is just a small part of the spectrum), and so that's when even the sun bows to inana/earth and everything now revolves around this ultra self-serving woman. the people around her perceived her, and she grew into bigger and bigger form until she caused an inversion, where the inside became so loud inside of itself, it popped (like ann egg) and the inside became the outside. we live on top of the centre of the universe -- and so what I believe is that myth is talking about how we/different people eventually perecieved someone that thinks they're the centre of the universe. total societal collapse. enter the aryans red (btw the sumerians were the aryans black, like hitler) and now we're all (or at least should be by now) children of desire, which means that we are also connected to that constantly increasing signal called desire. it causes all things to grow (and our resistance/dependence causes it to slow/stop) and it's in all things. it's that life essence, and I'd kinda like to imagine that the furthest we've gone down the rabbit hole is into what I'm calling the conceptual. it's fully possible to build a new interpretter for higher and higher frequencies. we are receptive beings, so why now just add on more wavelengths? why not cusxtomise it.
    it's a really tragic story though for any stone age culture, because they didn't notice anything different, but eventually desire is making those cultrus ssystems more and more obsolete to keep up with the new harmonics, and it turned into complete outrage and awfulness if that's what one was experincing, or the manifestation/realisation of one's greatestt/desire *or fear* (and usually both in the same body). all things collapsed because we essentially lived on the inside of the earth/egg and that is like the imagination. that imagination travels toward the inner sun, which means that originally we were built all as a reflection of the universe, and then when inana descended, then she essentially kicked thoth out of physical and became the new 3d. we essentially fell out of our symbolic inner-skull imagination and into the harsh 3d outer-skull reality that we're all "cast out" of the inner earth's glorious realms.
      the way that I imagine tmat it would be is after passing the inverse, from then on, you're going into more and more dense plasma as one approachs the inner core, which is basically like super duper ultra dense hydrogen. the blackest of black. however, we humans don't see the hydrogen, instead we see the imagination of that "time" (world-view). I don't have a pinecone, so I see 3d reality. that was necessary to get me into this weightless state of desire. I believe it's going to be possible to be impure-desire (that is, contaminated by the imagination), and we'll call those ones insects. I perfer however to be a plant. I don't care for the pinecone, and prefer to see things the way I want to see them (like a plant). I'm just another antennae/hair/plant on the surface of the earth, just like most everyone else. I probably live in the inner world of the earth, where there's a pretty good simulation of what's going on the surface. anyway, what I think is happening is that we're going to eventually POP, and the sides will flip. you all will enter into the underworld (where I'm at now), and I'll go into the outer. the universe is ours/mine for the taking. some people will interpret that all sorts of different ways and do all sorts of things, but I don't care, cause I'll prolly chill on earth for the rest of my life. there's so much crazy cool stuff here that it's not really much necessary (yet) for me to want to see other places yet (like who knows -- maybe a trip to mars for a day would be fun -- cause it prolly looks a whole lot like pueblo co (where I live on "earth")). anyway, I have no idea where I live, as that seems to be quite the coverup in my day and age, but I don't really have so much worry, because desire is always finding an improvement. only something like desire could live forever, until of course she gets bored and wants to do something else, duh. [break time, brb]
