### 2023-06-02 17:36 - the concept in a nutshell

I could see a comic book like thing where the bigfoot (enkidu) is stylised in an artistic way. the enkidu isn't just one guy, but actually a whole race of beings. so, here's the story: (first, gilgamesh is a character like the simpsons, where he doesn't have any character development; the only character development (perhaps at the beginning) is enkidu). gilgamesh is doing really awesome dude stuff, and he sees enkidu out in the forest/field/whatever, and he notices him. somehow this sighting of something, new, excoting, and starange (but also kinda scary) is cOntrasted with gil's super bro ways
    I think gil will be anything from a modern bro to an ancient bro (which gives a lot of room for storytelling about things in the past).
and the way that they meet is going to be the main part of the story. the backstory to this is that enkidu was constructed as a physical implementation of an vulcan; the caveat is that he doesn't see his physical attributes, only perceiving an astral picture Of what enkidu believes the world is like.
enkidu is *extremely perceptive*, and because he's conceptual, he perceives time in a conceptual way, meaning that he just tunes in to various parts of human history, and just observes, and reflects on what he's seeing. humans are very interesting because he can't really conceptualise very well their understanding (he doesn't yet perceive desire, just being a purely reflective being of something he observes).
sometimes though, something he observes
  remember he always sees our world through his astral lens: the way he wants/thinks it should look'
pulls him into our reality though, and upon arriving here on earth, he sees himself physically for the first time, and notices that he's *very hairy* and not at all like the humans he was watching on earth.
so, whenever enkidu finds himself in our physical reality, he's extremely frightened and doesn't know what to do:
  imagine a world that's always looked the way you liked to see it (pure exctasy), and whenever you didn't like it, you could just tune in elsewhere in time/space to something that you liked; but now, he's trapped in physical, and he tries to change his reality, but it doesn't change to what he wants, and so he's mainly just hiding from these hideous and awful-feeling beings out there in the world (humans).
he likes gilgamesh-like people though, because he grew up in a very male-dominator-society and a *LOT OF PSYCHEDELLICS*, and se he finds the people that take charge of the situation and push their way through the problems or whatever is *extremely* attractive
  think about what it's like to be on a heroic dose of mushrooms with a bunch of other dudes: you don't want to around a bunch of guys that are wimps; you will want a leader; someone who is strong, takes change and makes whatever happen, and so for him (who's used to eating essentially a diet of only psylocybin mushrooms), so a guy like gilgamesh is *EXTREMELY NICE* (very nice).

now that I've destroyed the idea with an unbelievable story, let's talk about vulcan (enkidu's fathter): he lives in a star system called vega, and to us, he would not really be visible. from our perspective, this is a frequency so high, it's beyond anything visible/UV, so for us, this is a pretty much *invisible* planet. it emits light similar to how the sun does, in that it it's attracting the light, and then in it's frequency aura, the frequencies that match certain wavelengths (of varying shapes and sizes) get instantiated into "light" (photons); it doesn't emit light like jupiter or venus does, but like the sun or venus. the crazy thing about vega though is that it does emit photons like jupiter (and not like earth's sun) which is how sometimes these enkidu get instantiated into light: sometimes in physical form, and sometimes into en embryo (you know those explosions of concppt are extremely enjoyable to them: very very pleasurable (which is gil's (soon to be) favourite thing he discovers hidden in such a wild man)).
  enkidu in human form (when birthed from a woman) are *extremely* hairy, and grow up very very timid and withdrawn (I suppose a side-plot could be that some women have figured out how to birth less hairy children though, so some enkidu are born basically looking fully human).
vulcan is himself just a concept, living in such an abstract form, he resonates with (and therefore has interacted with (through enkidu's sexual exploits)) a whole bunch of different archetypes, and so therefore each enkidu is sorta like self-programmed, with the different archetypes that he wants to display and in certain scenarios (and as another side-plot, one of the thing that one enkidu can learn about another is that they use varying techniques (cause they're self-programmed) to analyse their display: which archetypes, what symbols, actions, etc.) and so there's a lot of room for character development for enkidu (plural) through their exploits.
  therefore, one can easily see that vulcan is kind of like the sum total of all of these enkidu as a single organism: you have trillions of cells in your body, and enkidu are only billions at the moment, but there will be more. (brb)

### 2023-06-02 18:56 - the symbolic soul of enkidu

if we can consider a girl two competing concepts (X2), enkidu is the complete picture of all of those symbols formed into one expression (Y2). to explain this idea, let us consider that a cOncept (X) is a physical instantiation of a bunch of feelings into one resonating thing: it contains your mood in the moment, your mood overall, society's mood (in moment&collective), your social situation's mood, point in time and space, etc. all of that creates a frequency
  which is your astrological birth "sign": a complex feeling that is all of that + whatever is added/subtraced from the moment of conceptualisation
    (for those born of the woom), and/or the "big idea" -- the realisation of something that was felt (like in the woods or some other naturally good-feeling place) has become physical: the enkidu.
and that frequency matches the frequency of a number of different archetypes (which is why enkidu constantly finds himself attracted to and becoming physical with these strong macho-men bros).
  he's had ancient-bros, medieval-bros, rennaissance-bros, stone-age-bros, bronze-age-bros, etc; lots and lots of bros who can help him through his psychedellic journey
    for enkidu, he's just on another trip (mushrooms give a very wide range of trips, and aren't always consistent or very manageable), and the experience he's having is just a symbolic, narrative type experience where he "learns" (cause he's basically a conceptual program/frequency/soul) what symbols are good in what physical/feeling/conceptual/emotional situations and what ones are not not.
    each enkidu has had untold number of failures, each time not correctly analysing the situation correctly and responded properly, causing a catastrophic outcome
      (potential important plot detail for the retelling of the epic-of-gilgamesh)
    and so he's on this quest to find the best bro to guide him through his extremely frightening experience.
  bros may not be what he's looking for though, so he ends up experiementing with a lot of diffrent tactics to try and find a great pal to be with. he really just wants a friend, and bros can come to hurt him and cause him pain. there's a lot of room for tragic stories here as well, because he thinks he's ugly (looking at physical) and wants so badly to get back to "heaven" where he looks the way he wants to look again (a perfect reflection of the situations he chooses to observe)
so imagine one concept resonates with a number of different symbols: all of those symbols, in the porportion they resonate produce a sort of "big-picture" of how all of those symbols/archetypes fit together. each big-picture narrative (Y) is a full sttructure (the-manual) of how the universe works (final edition, of course) in narrative form:
  good-guys do this, and bad-guys do that; these are the consequences for your actions, and this is what "justice" looks like, here's what is "good" and here's what's "evil" ( narrative belief (through XP) that reality works "in this way" (*and*) "this is the 'right way'", in the form of sequences of symbols and actions, much like how memory becomes before it becomes just a feeling or concept, or a portion of a screen play)
and so each *pure* enkidu (Y2) (there are obviously hybrids that share a female/conceptual (X) counterpart), is the balance between two (often times conflicting pig-picture narrative of reality: the-manual) has this constant internal struggle where he's trying to figure out which way (this is the design of his program) to figure out what reality is more real and predictable than the other. experiences alter that big-picture of reality and take on the form of XP (geezers have the most, especially the Y2 ones), and they continue to improve upon their big-picture.
  most of the time, when enkidu finds himself in human form, only one half makes it into a body though, and the other half finds itself in another body (these are "soul mates" obviously), and so these are two humans, separated at birth (gemini twins) that are ultimately very attracted to each other, having worked out many improvements to the big picture in other instantiations on earth previously (whole different alternate/sub-plot)
the entire goal of each enkidu is just to find a way to preduct their past/present/future with their best form of reality, but they keep getting distracted by this stuff called "desire" which causes them to behave in extremely unnatural ways (like taking control over the body), and they don't really know that (besides that being the motivating part of the narrative optimisation algorithm), desire is the whole point of coming to earth in the first place: that experience *is* what they're looking for.

### 2023-06-02 19:37 - implementation ideas

though I like the idea of there being a sort of "canon" to the universe, the universe doesn't need to (brb 21:05) have any official story or anything like that. in fact, I'm designing the universe such that every story in every situation is completely valid. the fact that we (humans) have come up with an archetype or symbol, means that story can exist and is actually valid.
  when every story is valid (because they all are), these poor enkidu quickly run into a problem when they find theirselves instatiated into an earth body: simply because the narrative doesn't always work out the way they wanted it to work out, producing an epic *fail* -- so shame and embarrassment that their pig-picture didn't work out the narrative the way they had imagined. they keep trying to figure out what the "right" thing to do in various situations (according to their narratives they've lived), and to put it plainly, they've almost all failed.
what that means then, is this universe is a collection of *all* stories, which because they're a reflection of the author's imagination, are all "real" and cannon. it's a universe of 100% fan-fiction.

the other thing to note is that there are no restrictions on genders, and new configurations are both accepted, and also encouraged. for example, the base 3/4 combinations are: XX, XY, YX, and YY (order matters for XY/YX, because "gender" just says there that concept comes before symbolic/narrative or narrative/symbolic before concept, and body type can be anything from [wo]men to machine).
  in the future, I imagine that there will be humans with 3 or more as well: consider that an XXY, YXX, YYX, XYX, etc. could be present on the earth today and they'd be indistinguishable from other humans (appearing physically with a male or female body model/archetype). it's also possible we'll add on more body archetypes, as well.
I want to implement the concept of a body archetype as well, where an instantiated being takes on the form of a model body (remember enkidu perceives things in pictures/astral, so his perception of himself in astral will have the body archetype that he sees (and wants you tto also see)).

the next thing to note (in implementation details) is that each character profile is a set of narrative items that describe what happens in a certain situation: a sort of protocol for how to behave. this is the way that enkidu believes he "is" (I-am), and so users will enumerate the way that their character will behave in certain situations, like "when confronted with a physically frightening situation I (run|hide|defend myself|attack|etc) and then, the user can then try out those behaviours in different conceptual situations (which are a general feeling -- like say I'm in a state of euphoria, and I'm walking on clouds -- then do I still run/hide/etc when someone physically assaults me?) the way that different users try out these situations will largely be conducted in the imagination, and then recorded (somehow) into the (I-am) of the character. this is how the enkidu believes he'll respond when confronted with a bro in that situation. the more situations the enkidu goes through, the more XP that enkidu has, and so he's got a much richer character to draw from (from the author's perspective, wanting to include this enkidu into their fan-fiction story).
  the design of the bros will also be important, as they're going to be anything from reall assholes, to extremely selfish and bigoted/mean individuals -- some very loving, and some tragically flawed in very unfortunate ways. they'll also get an I-am, just the same as enkidu.
all of the symbolic I-am (Y) is going to be symbols and actions sequences (per concept/feeling), and the conceptual I-do (X) is a state machine: a pure thing that says: when I feel this way, then these things are possible, and when I feel another way, other things are possible -- making the obvious goal and motivating factorr for the I-do, to find a way to get the I-am to make the I-do feel like doing the thing that the I-am wants them to do (notice how this eventually creates engagement syntaxes/narratives, (especially) for romantic encounters (with broken/unsure/curious individuals)).
  this is the final goal of the website; and there is a lot of room for technology to make this these different character formats very HD, interactive, and approachable/consumable, so there's nearly Infinite monetisation potential here (hollywood, games, etc.).

### 2023-06-03 10:35 - a little bit about symbols/concepts

symbols are absolute and do not change. they're stable vibrators, meaning that they don't have any fluctuations in them. originally, the earth was created (by enki) to be a symbol all to itself. it didn't work though because nothing here is constant. so while all of the different beings (forms and species) performed their function in a stable way, there was very little expansion. the big-picture (Y) which is above the symbolic does something special, and this is the "fire" that proemetheus gave us, in that we're able to see the big-picture.
  it's very uncommon for everything perceived (nowadays) to be pretty close to a pure symbol. during the time of enki, the astral/physical form was constrained to be as close as possible to the symbol that it represented, and this was reinforced with megalithic structures
    whos vibration is constantly the size of the rocks that were used to build them), meaning that the only moving part was proportional space (ex. if everything grows by 150%, all the structures still work) and resonant time (which applies to concepts -- so I'm getting ahead of myself.
  what happens is, because of so many variables that all need to fit together perfectly (imagine this like an enormous codebase, like google or something), eventually there comes a time when things don't all fit into the same building blocks (each form, like DNA is a collection of building blocks (symbols,operations,actions,behaviours,etc) that composes the full symbol/archetype/species), and so what happens is new building blocks need to be constantly created to accomodate for the increasing variation of new requirements/vacancies/use-cases/etc (like for example, imagine overpopulation of a species will require a new species to keep its population from going too high, and if there isn't a species that hunts/consumes that, one needs to be created to fix the overpopulation "bug").
  all of these "edge cases" (things that don't perfectly fit inside or are resolved by a symbol or system) are what I'll call "concepts" -- things that aren't exactly one form or another; inotherwords, they resonate with more than one symbol: imagine an idea that's reliable, safe, and fast -- no such data structure exists, so it's an abstract concept that has no physical or symbolic counterpart -- an ideal -- and that ideal is founded on desire, therfore, each application/species/physical instantiation must pick the tradeoff which best suits it: fast and reliable, but not safe -- or relable and safe, but not fast (etc.).
therefore when we're looking at something from the conceptual standpoint (X), we can consider the concept is itself the best representation of desire in the form of (abstract) ideals. the big-picture is the opposite end of that: it's the current codebase (the-manual) in its currently *perceived* form. some code runs well, and some code does not -- and each codebase has its own way of performing its function. that "function" is what I'll call "the universe": each Y is a tiny little universe, that has a full picture ("the right way") condensed into a very tiny form.
  that tiny bit of code (I call it LOA) is run on every single particle and instantiation of "light" we know about. we'll call this symbolic perception of how everything comes into being, the solar function, out of which all light and beingness comes from.
  add too much extra code on to that big-picture and it starts to bog down. keep it simple, and life is repetitive and boring.
therefore, the goal of prometheus' fire (big-picture) is to find a way for any new desire to come into being.
it's very difficult for desire to be found inside of a symbol, so instead, desire is perceived on a conceptual level (cause it obviously doesn't fit into anything extant), meaning that it resonates with more than one symbol at a time (including ones that seemingly conflict in symbolic form); so, what ends up happening is that big-picture (symbolic representation) needs to be expanded and moved around to accomodate for the new requirements of the system to accomodate that desire.
  old stuff has to get thrown out, rewritten, changed, etc -- and so anything resistant to change is still one of those physical instantiations, still tuned into an outdated big-picture symbol (like say they're still using american-culture-502.1, and haven't updated to the new american-culture-1000's era where the big-picture now is (a symbolic system able to accomodate all things desired by any/every american alive))
  obviously, we can't just "tune in" to the latest version so easily (though we could, if we knew all the component parts), cause it's the composite of every concept/ideal in the big-picture of everyone tuned into that system
    I prolly should have used earth-culture as the example, but I wanted to show that it's culture (our current beliefs and ideas about how stuff works) which holds us back, but then again if we have earth-culture, then half of the difficulty is done away with (seeing one culture as better/worse/superior than another). american-culture fails because it's hard to define who is a part of american-culture, cause american-culture is influenced by everyone that uses it (which is pretty much almost everyone on earth)
therefore, we have two competing ways to look at the accomplishment of an ideal: resonance/harmony with that ideal (and the exclusion of those that don't fit it): X, and the big-picture monolithic symbolic system where everything that's important to me is possible: Y

it's now possible to see the internal conflict created by Y and X working together:
  the ideal implementation is a Y (similar to the one that I've constructed) where the X perfectly fits into the system of the Y (which for me is basically LOA and little narrative), and so therefore desire is easy to find an implementation for, because each and evvery concept is resonant with whatever symbols it uses, and none of those symbols are a "threat" (fear, desire for something bad to happen) to me.
the Y (I-am) must find a way for the X (I-do) to be able to operate inside of the system, where all input vibrations come out as equal or faster (expansion/growth), and NOT into lower vibrations (heat, sound, etc) all the physical. the I-do doesn't perform the translation into physical (that is lowering of the (concept's) vibration from x-ray down into visible/heat/sound/etc), and that's instead the job of the I-am.
  the most difficult of the cases would be for the YY pair, because they're both I-am, meaning they have two competing "right ways" to look at something, and all manifestations of theirself will be a instantiation of one of those ways. I (personally) have no idea how to conceptualise this, and so I'm just kinda extrapolating on the idea.
    the way it feels to me, is that I have two competing ideas on how it should go, but I have no energy with which to make it happen; when I say "energy" I mean motivation -- because motivation comes from desire to accomplish the ideal (in the form of concept) -- and the only concepts I have to work with, come from the opposing "right way" -- meaning that I'm going to have to find a way of integrating the ideals of another system into my own -- and the thing is, the other system has those ideals *already implemented*, so I have to find a way of either doing it differently, or copying them and integrating it into my own (this is your classic bro-v-bro conflict: do I copy them, or implement my own version a little twisted from theirs). (brb)

### 2023-06-03 17:23 - YYX is your basic setup

also, the XYY combination as well, because it's your basic charactor, actor, reflector setup. on one side you have the charactor/**(centre)**, between the opposite side you have the actor/**(foil)**/ground which channels/absorbs/emits both kinds of energies equally, so they are like software programmable reflectors (like myself), the **(centre)** is both, a self-emitting and also that foil at the same time, meaning I reflect, but the energy I emit, isn't really my own, but instead a transformed reflection. think like a galaxy does, where you're reflecting back (reacting) to other substantial conncepts (stars) in the galaxy; you're on the outside of the galaxy looking in -- and from that perspective, I can see that I've basxically got a reaction/position for every thing/concept in my perception; that perception is, I think for the most part higher dimensions than 3,
  I think our galaxy is a real upstart, attempting the impossible: realising a galaxy in 3 dimensions
    is incredible, but what about 2d???? ---
      wait, yeah what do you guys think about trying to see if we could fit all of our concepts into only *2* dimensions!! think about that dude: flat glalaxy.
      common guys, you know you want to.
      it's the chance of a lifetime.
      think about it: we could be the first galaxy where stars are only distant to each other in 2 dimensions. think about those crazy orbits... everyone will be in their little kingdom. I bet it'll take a race of people tons and tons of time to finally figure out there's a top/bottom to their flat plane, in which they can see a "broader perspective". just think about how unlikely they'll ever think to go vertical really far into space, and look back (to see the arrangement of stars -- cause it'll just look like a crazy horizon of just starlight (from their perspective)).
      cool idea; I'll have to try and remember that one day in the future (#fun-projects)
but the tthing is, I perceive everyone around me, so I too render every other ball of light (concept) into a physical image, as well
  -- like I already do this, so I'm saying that I have galactic perception.
and everything that I see around me is a concept: from the people to the individual atoms theirselves, and all manner of invisible ideas, as well: think about how we don't really see all of the stuff like culture as a visible idea, but it's noticeable
  -- like different things, from the phonebooths, to the interaction of the people in it, has the look of that culture (and/or village).
    every part of this planet emits a different form of conceeptual frequency: we see it and can identify it in the culture and the objects and even the people, but not it's like like you can point to it and say, "ah, there it is: there is spanish/american culture rightt there (and then point to It)"
and so a lot of a part of the galaxy/planet/universe/whatever is just looking out/in to that world and *beholding* those concepts (cause many aren't visible) -- and every single human being alive is doing thatt right now. we are all those wonderful centres (including the atoms and every other concept) -- we're all stars/universes/people, on the one hand and galaxies/planets/cellular life. what I mean is, we're aall destined to become stars, whether we like it or not, because we're all having the human experience, which is either inside-out or outside-in.
  because they're both functionally the same, one only has to imagine that there are complimentaries for each -- a sort of ratiod proportion of inside-out/positive and to outside-in/negative perception.
    just think in terms of vertices, and electricity. in a vortex, the amounts on positive and negative, are proportioned, but for example, in electricity, they are not proportioned at all, and are thererfore "controlled" by how fast they're going.
      think about it: if everyone is resting at about zero, like lots of rocks and minerals base/stable elements stuff, then there's not much movementt, so there are some amount of inside-out or outside-in perspetives flowing at one time. it's not often the case that everyone is going in the same direction though; (it's a current based on attraction -- where the wires are just the guide for the energy to arrive the attractor). therefore, there could be one of those types that flow opposite the current: so if there are a bunch of outside-in types, all going in one direction, and suddenly an inside-out one goes tearing through the wire, do you think it's going to be going the speed of light??
        I'm the stuff that electrical disasters are made of:
        SOLAR ENERGY! (it goes the wrong way)
(brb 18:03) and are there consequences for telling people the way that the universe works? well, from my perspective, they're going to have to figure it our for theirselves. they can ean live eternally and figure it out, or they can jump back into a sort of conceptual reality matrix that's relatable to them -- sure. I don't have any problem with what anyone else does,
  -- so here's the thing: what I'm doing is just going eternal, right (like a star) -- so when I finally decide I want to start over, I'll do that (cause I mean, what if I get bored, right?)
    -- but then you have to wonder
    -- do stars ever get bored living out experiences with other stars in (outside-in) planets?
    I doubt it happens actually, because with the advent of novelty in 3 dimensions, there's no doubt that you wouldn't *want* to stay a little while longer in 3d.
    I know I do, right -- like I'm in no rush to get out -- cause I love it here, and so it's only you guys (in this strange reality matrix of universe-centric mofos) that'll,
      have to figure it out for yourselves in your universe
        which will probably look a lot like alternate variations of this time sequence --
          like reliving the dream, but in a new environment --
          kinda like your own matrix of rememberance.
  I'm telling people stuff because it may make it easier for them later, and I don't really *pay* anything for it later,
    because I don't have adversion to hearing other good ideas.
    so, if someone else does the same thing to me (that I'm doing here, I love it, and would love to see other peolpe's (in my opinion) *good* (lol) ideas as well),
      soo see how I invite in other people to try and steer their opinions into my life?
        to me, this is quite fun and creates a lot of drama and people trying to stop me -- so I just cruise through and laugh at the bad ideas
      I swim through bad ideas faster than all of the rest (cause of low/negative resistance), I wonder what attracts that kind of thing? I bet tesla would know...
      I bet he may have tried to conjure/attract the manifestation of such a low/negative resistance **(concept/centre)** into reality.
    it may have been one of the ways that I got here --
      I have no idea -- but it's hard to fight with negative resistance.
    I know that we attract others that are similar resistance to my own -- so it's sorta like a tidal wave of low and then negative resistance people...
      in that sense, it's the end of the world (as we know it), yeah (and I'll be fine, lol)
