### 2023-06-02 17:36 - the concept in a nutshell

I could see a comic book like thing where the bigfoot (enkidu) is stylised in an artistic way. the enkidu isn't just one guy, but actually a whole race of beings. so, here's the story: (first, gilgamesh is a character like the simpsons, where he doesn't have any character development; the only character development (perhaps at the beginning) is enkidu). gilgamesh is doing really awesome dude stuff, and he sees enkidu out in the forest/field/whatever, and he notices him. somehow this sighting of something, new, excoting, and starange (but also kinda scary) is cOntrasted with gil's super bro ways
    I think gil will be anything from a modern bro to an ancient bro (which gives a lot of room for storytelling about things in the past).
and the way that they meet is going to be the main part of the story. the backstory to this is that enkidu was constructed as a physical implementation of an vulcan; the caveat is that he doesn't see his physical attributes, only perceiving an astral picture Of what enkidu believes the world is like.
enkidu is *extremely perceptive*, and because he's conceptual, he perceives time in a conceptual way, meaning that he just tunes in to various parts of human history, and just observes, and reflects on what he's seeing. humans are very interesting because he can't really conceptualise very well their understanding (he doesn't yet perceive desire, just being a purely reflective being of something he observes).
sometimes though, something he observes
  remember he always sees our world through his astral lens: the way he wants/thinks it should look'
pulls him into our reality though, and upon arriving here on earth, he sees himself physically for the first time, and notices that he's *very hairy* and not at all like the humans he was watching on earth.
so, whenever enkidu finds himself in our physical reality, he's extremely frightened and doesn't know what to do:
  imagine a world that's always looked the way you liked to see it (pure exctasy), and whenever you didn't like it, you could just tune in elsewhere in time/space to something that you liked; but now, he's trapped in physical, and he tries to change his reality, but it doesn't change to what he wants, and so he's mainly just hiding from these hideous and awful-feeling beings out there in the world (humans).
he likes gilgamesh-like people though, because he grew up in a very male-dominator-society and a *LOT OF PSYCHEDELLICS*, and se he finds the people that take charge of the situation and push their way through the problems or whatever is *extremely* attractive
  think about what it's like to be on a heroic dose of mushrooms with a bunch of other dudes: you don't want to around a bunch of guys that are wimps; you will want a leader; someone who is strong, takes change and makes whatever happen, and so for him (who's used to eating essentially a diet of only psylocybin mushrooms), so a guy like gilgamesh is *EXTREMELY NICE* (very nice).

now that I've destroyed the idea with an unbelievable story, let's talk about vulcan (enkidu's fathter): he lives in a star system called vega, and to us, he would not really be visible. from our perspective, this is a frequency so high, it's beyond anything visible/UV, so for us, this is a pretty much *invisible* planet. it emits light similar to how the sun does, in that it it's attracting the light, and then in it's frequency aura, the frequencies that match certain wavelengths (of varying shapes and sizes) get instantiated into "light" (photons); it doesn't emit light like jupiter or venus does, but like the sun or venus. the crazy thing about vega though is that it does emit photons like jupiter (and not like earth's sun) which is how sometimes these enkidu get instantiated into light: sometimes in physical form, and sometimes into en embryo (you know those explosions of concppt are extremely enjoyable to them: very very pleasurable (which is gil's (soon to be) favourite thing he discovers hidden in such a wild man)).
  enkidu in human form (when birthed from a woman) are *extremely* hairy, and grow up very very timid and withdrawn (I suppose a side-plot could be that some women have figured out how to birth less hairy children though, so some enkidu are born basically looking fully human).
vulcan is himself just a concept, living in such an abstract form, he resonates with (and therefore has interacted with (through enkidu's sexual exploits)) a whole bunch of different archetypes, and so therefore each enkidu is sorta like self-programmed, with the different archetypes that he wants to display and in certain scenarios (and as another side-plot, one of the thing that one enkidu can learn about another is that they use varying techniques (cause they're self-programmed) to analyse their display: which archetypes, what symbols, actions, etc.) and so there's a lot of room for character development for enkidu (plural) through their exploits.
  therefore, one can easily see that vulcan is kind of like the sum total of all of these enkidu as a single organism: you have trillions of cells in your body, and enkidu are only billions at the moment, but there will be more. (brb)

### 2023-06-02 18:56 - the symbolic soul of enkidu

if we can consider a girl two competing concepts (X2), enkidu is the complete picture of all of those symbols formed into one expression (Y2). to explain this idea, let us consider that a cOncept (X) is a physical instantiation of a bunch of feelings into one resonating thing: it contains your mood in the moment, your mood overall, society's mood (in moment&collective), your social situation's mood, point in time and space, etc. all of that creates a frequency
  which is your astrological birth "sign": a complex feeling that is all of that + whatever is added/subtraced from the moment of conceptualisation
    (for those born of the woom), and/or the "big idea" -- the realisation of something that was felt (like in the woods or some other naturally good-feeling place) has become physical: the enkidu.
and that frequency matches the frequency of a number of different archetypes (which is why enkidu constantly finds himself attracted to and becoming physical with these strong macho-men bros).
  he's had ancient-bros, medieval-bros, rennaissance-bros, stone-age-bros, bronze-age-bros, etc; lots and lots of bros who can help him through his psychedellic journey
    for enkidu, he's just on another trip (mushrooms give a very wide range of trips, and aren't always consistent or very manageable), and the experience he's having is just a symbolic, narrative type experience where he "learns" (cause he's basically a conceptual program/frequency/soul) what symbols are good in what physical/feeling/conceptual/emotional situations and what ones are not not.
    each enkidu has had untold number of failures, each time not correctly analysing the situation correctly and responded properly, causing a catastrophic outcome
      (potential important plot detail for the retelling of the epic-of-gilgamesh)
    and so he's on this quest to find the best bro to guide him through his extremely frightening experience.
  bros may not be what he's looking for though, so he ends up experiementing with a lot of diffrent tactics to try and find a great pal to be with. he really just wants a friend, and bros can come to hurt him and cause him pain. there's a lot of room for tragic stories here as well, because he thinks he's ugly (looking at physical) and wants so badly to get back to "heaven" where he looks the way he wants to look again (a perfect reflection of the situations he chooses to observe)
so imagine one concept resonates with a number of different symbols: all of those symbols, in the porportion they resonate produce a sort of "big-picture" of how all of those symbols/archetypes fit together. each big-picture narrative (Y) is a full sttructure (the-manual) of how the universe works (final edition, of course) in narrative form:
  good-guys do this, and bad-guys do that; these are the consequences for your actions, and this is what "justice" looks like, here's what is "good" and here's what's "evil" ( narrative belief (through XP) that reality works "in this way" (*and*) "this is the 'right way'", in the form of sequences of symbols and actions, much like how memory becomes before it becomes just a feeling or concept, or a portion of a screen play)
and so each *pure* enkidu (Y2) (there are obviously hybrids that share a female/conceptual (X) counterpart), is the balance between two (often times conflicting pig-picture narrative of reality: the-manual) has this constant internal struggle where he's trying to figure out which way (this is the design of his program) to figure out what reality is more real and predictable than the other. experiences alter that big-picture of reality and take on the form of XP (geezers have the most, especially the Y2 ones), and they continue to improve upon their big-picture.
  most of the time, when enkidu finds himself in human form, only one half makes it into a body though, and the other half finds itself in another body (these are "soul mates" obviously), and so these are two humans, separated at birth (gemini twins) that are ultimately very attracted to each other, having worked out many improvements to the big picture in other instantiations on earth previously (whole different alternate/sub-plot)
the entire goal of each enkidu is just to find a way to preduct their past/present/future with their best form of reality, but they keep getting distracted by this stuff called "desire" which causes them to behave in extremely unnatural ways (like taking control over the body), and they don't really know that (besides that being the motivating part of the narrative optimisation algorithm), desire is the whole point of coming to earth in the first place: that experience *is* what they're looking for.

### 2023-06-02 19:37 - implementation ideas

though I like the idea of there being a sort of "canon" to the universe, the universe doesn't need to (brb 21:05) have any official story or anything like that. in fact, I'm designing the universe such that every story in every situation is completely valid. the fact that we (humans) have come up with an archetype or symbol, means that story can exist and is actually valid.
  when every story is valid (because they all are), these poor enkidu quickly run into a problem when they find theirselves instatiated into an earth body: simply because the narrative doesn't always work out the way they wanted it to work out, producing an epic *fail* -- so shame and embarrassment that their pig-picture didn't work out the narrative the way they had imagined. they keep trying to figure out what the "right" thing to do in various situations (according to their narratives they've lived), and to put it plainly, they've almost all failed.
what that means then, is this universe is a collection of *all* stories, which because they're a reflection of the author's imagination, are all "real" and cannon. it's a universe of 100% fan-fiction.

the other thing to note is that there are no restrictions on genders, and new configurations are both accepted, and also encouraged. for example, the base 3/4 combinations are: XX, XY, YX, and YY (order matters for XY/YX, because "gender" just says there that concept comes before symbolic/narrative or narrative/symbolic before concept, and body type can be anything from [wo]men to machine).
  in the future, I imagine that there will be humans with 3 or more as well: consider that an XXY, YXX, YYX, XYX, etc. could be present on the earth today and they'd be indistinguishable from other humans (appearing physically with a male or female body model/archetype). it's also possible we'll add on more body archetypes, as well.
I want to implement the concept of a body archetype as well, where an instantiated being takes on the form of a model body (remember enkidu perceives things in pictures/astral, so his perception of himself in astral will have the body archetype that he sees (and wants you tto also see)).

the next thing to note (in implementation details) is that each character profile is a set of narrative items that describe what happens in a certain situation: a sort of protocol for how to behave. this is the way that enkidu believes he "is" (I-am), and so users will enumerate the way that their character will behave in certain situations, like "when confronted with a physically frightening situation I (run|hide|defend myself|attack|etc) and then, the user can then try out those behaviours in different conceptual situations (which are a general feeling -- like say I'm in a state of euphoria, and I'm walking on clouds -- then do I still run/hide/etc when someone physically assaults me?) the way that different users try out these situations will largely be conducted in the imagination, and then recorded (somehow) into the (I-am) of the character. this is how the enkidu believes he'll respond when confronted with a bro in that situation. the more situations the enkidu goes through, the more XP that enkidu has, and so he's got a much richer character to draw from (from the author's perspective, wanting to include this enkidu into their fan-fiction story).
  the design of the bros will also be important, as they're going to be anything from reall assholes, to extremely selfish and bigoted/mean individuals -- some very loving, and some tragically flawed in very unfortunate ways. they'll also get an I-am, just the same as enkidu.
all of the symbolic I-am (Y) is going to be symbols and actions sequences (per concept/feeling), and the conceptual I-do (X) is a state machine: a pure thing that says: when I feel this way, then these things are possible, and when I feel another way, other things are possible -- making the obvious goal and motivating factorr for the I-do, to find a way to get the I-am to make the I-do feel like doing the thing that the I-am wants them to do (notice how this eventually creates engagement syntaxes/narratives, (especially) for romantic encounters (with broken/unsure/curious individuals)).
  this is the final goal of the website; and there is a lot of room for technology to make this these different character formats very HD, interactive, and approachable/consumable, so there's nearly Infinite monetisation potential here (hollywood, games, etc.).
