# business-plan

### 2023-06-08 18:02 - main idea

the goal of the business is to change the way that our DNA workss to be a little less like [*how it currently is*](TODO) and make it so that DNA works a little bit differently: my inspiration comes from enki,enlil&alalu's attempts to figure out how to best ways to work with the planet. I take inspiration from "lost book of enki" and also other places. the basics of the way that prometheus originally intended for the planet to work was based off of fire: (the form that divides this 3d space from the abstract/asymmetrical space). imagine for a moment the Y and it's in the centre; then around it, there are 4 points: two above and two below, at 90(degrees) from each other. now imagine water, with a large oxygen (the Y is small compared to the 4X points above and below), and again there are those four points above and below, forming a cross (when looking down from above). now, imagine two hydrogens occupying two of those four points; it could be both top, both bottom, or one top and one bottom. the two hydrogens will swap places with each other back and fourth, and this will create a slightly different frequency depending on the original configuration. you'll notice that two tops/bottoms creates a turning motion as they go up/down -- and whether they reverse the turning direttion, or whether they keep going in CW/CCW direction again changes things (because they keep turning in one direction but the "altitude" vibrates up and down (it's a different dimension than the XYZ we're used to seeing)).
  what it's going to end up being is that the movement of those points (and the vibration that they make) is what is determining how water and also the Y with X2
    btw, I've come to believe that when they say that males are XY/YX and females are X2, is that is inherently incorrect, as (see: enkidu-do) we probably are all XYX/XXY/YXX (and some of those are more than others, and the configuration of those determines which way you "turn", like the four tetrahedral points).
  and so what you end up with that configuration, is a very unstable form, because (like water) the XYX arranegement conforms to the vibrational environment that it's in
    which is why sometimes water spins left, right, or standing (both ways),
      this spinning left (charactor/emitter), right (reflector/receptive), and both ways (actor/ground), corresponds as well to the types of positions the triad.
    and that tetrahedral arrangement didn't really work very well for the planet, because of the sun, and IMO, it doesn't work [too well for us either](/README.md), because of reasons I haven't fully figured out yet, but the short of it is, that females that only have a XX arrangement (50% out of phase), are stuck in a system where their conceptual picture of the world (X), which is what gets highlighted/amplified, and what to do about it (should they be an emitter and not receptive), is totally messed up. it represents a very ancient world-view, and doesn't really serve us to notice those things, and [efforts to try and change it are stifled/destroyed](TODO) frequentially, so that very little change ever takes place, and the economic and narrative/law/justice/symbolic based reality, continues to operate (like like it'd be the end of the world (as we know it) if women conceived the world differently than they do now)
  and so, the goal is, therefore to move to a icosahedral/dodecahedral (pentagonal) format to gain a different take on things. the way this one works, is that there are 20 vertices/X that are around the Y, and somehow those interact in a way that works well (I'm still in R&D phase -- but intuititively I know this is the way to get to the chestahedron and the pen-rose (planetary gridworker's romance)).
    in order to get there, the way that I'm going to begin is simply learning how to manipulate frequencies on my computer starting with my [music-player](/music-player.md), and displaying those (using WASM/AssemblyScript) in both the canvas and also sound. for sound, there will be no more "time", as I'll just use divisions (2,3,5,7...) of the buffer for my "frequency" -- as, instead of basing it on a "second" in the absolute sense, the buffer size will always be the "maximum wavelength". I've got a pretty clear idea in my head of how to do it technically, because the first thing to do us to start using sound and hooking that up to different things (like tesla's mechnical oscillator). I know eventually, that with discoveries along the way, we'll be visualising and editing DNA in a short period of time.
