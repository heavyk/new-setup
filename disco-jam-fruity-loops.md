earlier today I watched tim leary's "operate your brain" song and I love how he made visuals using "shocking/mundane/sexy/ordinary/mechanical" images that have had the colours adjusted so it danced with the music. I want to do the same thing on a canvas with assembly-script. I also want to produce the beats for a similar sounding baseline for these types of songs:
- feel my love: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/W0DFAnMrbm0)
- the chase (moroder)
- all of steve monite
- jam on it: @[youtube](https://youtu.be/Q1Qdcl4ja1Y)

(without the vocals, obviously -- because later it'd be cool to have separate vocal tracks (and other things))

I want each song's sound to be simple code/routines that modify the array buffer output depending on some logic. I figure that such "chiptunes" (like the old nintendo stuff) will start to develop different ways to modify the stream: we're going to imagine that the length of the buffer is the length of the whole "wavelength". if we're going to think of the wavelength like a play, you have thing that describes the wave: it has a starting point, and and an ending place. sometimes (like the entire llength of the song) starts and ends at 0. a song is a sample and a sample is a song.
  each time the starting starting point is different than the ending point, we can think of this electrically as a number between -1,1 -- but we can also think of it in terms of notes too: so if I go up a fifth from where I started, the metadata for that "bit" says thatt: difference in frequency and also amplitude.
  different parts of these wave modifiers can be put together in a composition sequence to compose/create "sounds" and then put those together (with some orchestration) to make full songs that are programatically defined and orchestrated.
