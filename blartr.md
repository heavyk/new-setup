### 2023-05-21 15:24 - the difference in manifestation outcomes

today, greg and I had a long conversation (sounds ominous, doesn't it) about how I should start channeling my energy into something; namely, a podcast. the thing is, I'd love to make something where it publishes what I write and I can start getting feedback on it. the idea here is that ideas are only as good as their implementation, and very little of what I'm saying through my *documented* (cause a lot of stuff is undocumented and I'm still finding a better way to present the topic). I already publish on a regular basis, so why not just make it a thing; turn it into a more consumable format? imagine that I posted this stuff as a podcast though: it would completely chage the tone and feel of how I'm doing it, so the way I would want to do it actually may be emittr, or something like that, where I literally just broadcast about what I want. others can read my broadcast, but I will not be reading anyone else's -- (I guess unless they specifically ask he) because I simply don't care.
as my frequency continued to increase, I had to be more allowing of more types of scenarios in my experience,
    (which is in the emittr sense), "feeling the way you want to feel, no matter the situation"; 
    it's kinda difficult one to learn, you know, and I'm definitely a hypocrite still in practising what I preach all the time and stuff, but you can see my progress of getting better and better at it all the time.
    the thing is, I'm kinda still a diehard "fake it till you make it" kind of person -- so while I do have the character traits that I have, you can see that I'm still learning as I go, -- like everyone is, really -- if it looks like I'm just sorta making it up as I'm going along, it's cause I am...
I just have the privilage of discovering it and getting the chance to write about it, and so for others, what I'm doing is just discovering things on my own, so to get great new ideas from someone, like I did with greg today (about this idea), notice how much it changes the entire feeling of "the-manifestation" -- cause if all of a sudden I'm now in a podcasting mode where I'm just telling people things in a podcaster sense, I totally lose the sense of wonderment and discovery that is, figuring out life like I've done, working on new mythologies (cause any mythologically validated, ((and subsequently believed in)) past) *is* a valid present.
what I mean, is -- as I write these things out, for me it's just a fun discovery. I started out really *making a point* (all stars do), but I've kind of moved on from having to make a point; I suppose that on some level I'm obligated to react to a lot of stuff that people put in my present experience, and (for me), the majority of the stuff that others are interested in, just isn't registering any desire to care about: I live in world where (because I can allow more scenarios) I'm *only* doing what I want to do. -- it takes a moment to figure it out, but if I can feel however I want in more and more situations, I'm allowing more and more situations to take place, -- so why not figure out a mythology/reason/meaning to my reality with is satisfactory for my incredibly universe-size ego; I don't care what tit is, at this point because it just needs to match making something the size of what I can conceive.
  I perceive this as simply inside of the universe, every person is looking it from an inside-out or an outside-in perspective; I kinda do both a bit (cause I'm not visual with it), but they really are different:
  with outside-in, I see myself as one part of the universe; one piece in puzzle; cog in the machine, (TODO: add more funny examples), etc.: in I see myself as part of a bigger picture.
  with inside-out, everything is a reflection of me, and I'm the centre of my universe, cause all things are a reflection of me. I love that there are so many awesome other things, and that's really it, you know.
  I also noticed yesterday another species of perspectives, where I look "behind myself" -- and so  if I'm a sphere and I'm looking around in all ways at once, behind me could only be inside of me, right?
    you see, the thing is, I don't look on the inside of me, so I don't have any "behind me", so for me this is a funny question. if I can keep this inward vision limited, nosebook's problems would be solved, and I wouldn't have to ever look inside of me -- cause I'm a reflector. I suppose that they would be the "man behind the mirror" too, but I don't mind, as they're necessary for contrast -- and I'm even planning to make worse bad-guys than them, because bad-guys only work well with narration. when I perceive all things as a function of desire, all concepts are available to me. anyone who can prevent me from seeing the universe as a fuenction of desire, can limit my size, but then I grow back to going off toward infifinity again. every since time "they" (I'm really battling myself) find a way to limit me, I find another way to get around it.
    I'm always my own worst enemy, and it's for the obvious reason that I don't want to go faster than I improve my percEetions, because then I crash.
    as long as my perceptions evolve as fast as I do, I'm able to stay completely reflective of my environment and still feeling good. I belive it's been my goal to ensure that every night when I go to sleep, I get reset to the most disagreeable ("worst") timeline of all time -- so I really am, always living my "worst" manifestation (and desire to make it even *worse* than it is now, is increasing), -- because obviously I don't want to go faster than I can believe.
      you can imagine how interesting this perspective is from the "I've got to steer everything into place" type of person like myself -- and it's because I'm *sure* that I see the idea in it's *best* form.
      I've gotten around the habit of seeing my ideas as "the best", by actively engaging in coming up with bad ideas -- and inevitably how to sell them. I try to imagine the most clever sales pitches to the most extreme/outrageoous/*useless* stuff, that I really have started growing fond of actively looking the conspiratorial/sinister/terrible/awful/outrageous/bad ideas, and trying to figure out how to get them intigrated into my experience. I love a juicy drama filled with tons of intrigue and drama.
        there's this funny thing about some of israel's mythical history, which, (from our timeline's perspective) *didn't* happen -- but I claim that it *did* happen; just, not here. it's quite possible that I would have been involved with a lot of them, as I'm probably pretty cataclysmic/destructive -- meaning that the only thing remaining of those failed attempts is a mythology that didn't properly explain itself and the universe.
          in a system where you want to be as big as I want to be, it takes a bit for others to begin to perceive as large as I do, so *inevitably*, *if I'm here*, then I keep finding a way to dream that big, but the cultural/social/political framework just couldn't really support the idea, because they can't be a reflection of it,
          which means that I either have to *do it all myself*, or find a way to build cultural and social systems that can support a vision as large as mine.
          it's done by finding out what doesn't work and fixing what doesn't work, and what's broken and then just trying again; that is, my personality -- I just try another way and see what works.
          *if I were to go too fast*, then I don't get the feedbavk of something not working, and just blast right through it. they add up over time, and eventually it crechendos to a full collapse of some aspect of society.
            I don't like going fast. I like to feel resistance saying, "yeah that's not a good idea" -- and that allows for situations like today to work out -- because I could feel greg's resistance, and my own. combining that with my perspective (which makes all concepts/emotions easy to perceive) of *everything is a function of desire*,-- then I can find new things to look at from a new perspective.
          the reason why I've been putting off anything girls related is because I don't want to lose that slow sense and go blasting off into oblivion and lose my sense of resistance because I'm just blasting through everything at a million miles an hour. brb (16:23).
