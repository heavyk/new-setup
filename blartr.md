### 2023-05-21 15:24 - the difference in manifestation outcomes

today, greg and I had a long conversation (sounds ominous, doesn't it) about how I should start channeling my energy into something; namely, a podcast. the thing is, I'd love to make something where it publishes what I write and I can start getting feedback on it. the idea here is that ideas are only as good as their implementation, and very little of what I'm saying through my *documented* (cause a lot of stuff is undocumented and I'm still finding a better way to present the topic). I already publish on a regular basis, so why not just make it a thing; turn it into a more consumable format? imagine that I posted this stuff as a podcast though: it would completely chage the tone and feel of how I'm doing it, so the way I would want to do it actually may be emittr, or something like that, where I literally just broadcast about what I want. others can read my broadcast, but I will not be reading anyone else's -- (I guess unless they specifically ask he) because I simply don't care.
as my frequency continued to increase, I had to be more allowing of more types of scenarios in my experience,
    (which is in the emittr sense), "feeling the way you want to feel, no matter the situation"; 
    it's kinda difficult one to learn, you know, and I'm definitely a hypocrite still in practising what I preach all the time and stuff, but you can see my progress of getting better and better at it all the time.
    the thing is, I'm kinda still a diehard "fake it till you make it" kind of person -- so while I do have the character traits that I have, you can see that I'm still learning as I go, -- like everyone is, really -- if it looks like I'm just sorta making it up as I'm going along, it's cause I am...
I just have the privilage of discovering it and getting the chance to write about it, and so for others, what I'm doing is just discovering things on my own, so to get great new ideas from someone, like I did with greg today (about this idea), notice how much it changes the entire feeling of "the-manifestation" -- cause if all of a sudden I'm now in a podcasting mode where I'm just telling people things in a podcaster sense, I totally lose the sense of wonderment and discovery that is, figuring out life like I've done, working on new mythologies (cause any mythologically validated, ((and subsequently believed in)) past) *is* a valid present.
what I mean, is -- as I write these things out, for me it's just a fun discovery. I started out really *making a point* (all stars do), but I've kind of moved on from having to make a point; I suppose that on some level I'm obligated to react to a lot of stuff that people put in my present experience, and (for me), the majority of the stuff that others are interested in, just isn't registering any desire to care about: I live in world where (because I can allow more scenarios) I'm *only* doing what I want to do. -- it takes a moment to figure it out, but if I can feel however I want in more and more situations, I'm allowing more and more situations to take place, -- so why not figure out a mythology/reason/meaning to my reality with is satisfactory for my incredibly universe-size ego; I don't care what tit is, at this point because it just needs to match making something the size of what I can conceive.
  I perceive this as simply inside of the universe, every person is looking it from an inside-out or an outside-in perspective; I kinda do both a bit (cause I'm not visual with it), but they really are different:
  with outside-in, I see myself as one part of the universe; one piece in puzzle; cog in the machine, (TODO: add more funny examples), etc.: in I see myself as part of a bigger picture.
  with inside-out, everything is a reflection of me, and I'm the centre of my universe, cause all things are a reflection of me. I love that there are so many awesome other things, and that's really it, you know.
  I also noticed yesterday another species of perspectives, where I look "behind myself" -- and so  if I'm a sphere and I'm looking around in all ways at once, behind me could only be inside of me, right?
    you see, the thing is, I don't look on the inside of me, so I don't have any "behind me", so for me this is a funny question. if I can keep this inward vision limited, nosebook's problems would be solved, and I wouldn't have to ever look inside of me -- cause I'm a reflector. I suppose that they would be the "man behind the mirror" too, but I don't mind, as they're necessary for contrast -- and I'm even planning to make worse bad-guys than them, because bad-guys only work well with narration. when I perceive all things as a function of desire, all concepts are available to me. anyone who can prevent me from seeing the universe as a fuenction of desire, can limit my size, but then I grow back to going off toward infifinity again. every since time "they" (I'm really battling myself) find a way to limit me, I find another way to get around it.
    I'm always my own worst enemy, and it's for the obvious reason that I don't want to go faster than I improve my percEetions, because then I crash.
    as long as my perceptions evolve as fast as I do, I'm able to stay completely reflective of my environment and still feeling good. I belive it's been my goal to ensure that every night when I go to sleep, I get reset to the most disagreeable ("worst") timeline of all time -- so I really am, always living my "worst" manifestation (and desire to make it even *worse* than it is now, is increasing), -- because obviously I don't want to go faster than I can believe.
      you can imagine how interesting this perspective is from the "I've got to steer everything into place" type of person like myself -- and it's because I'm *sure* that I see the idea in it's *best* form.
      I've gotten around the habit of seeing my ideas as "the best", by actively engaging in coming up with bad ideas -- and inevitably how to sell them. I try to imagine the most clever sales pitches to the most extreme/outrageoous/*useless* stuff, that I really have started growing fond of actively looking the conspiratorial/sinister/terrible/awful/outrageous/bad ideas, and trying to figure out how to get them intigrated into my experience. I love a juicy drama filled with tons of intrigue and drama.
        there's this funny thing about some of israel's mythical history, which, (from our timeline's perspective) *didn't* happen -- but I claim that it *did* happen; just, not here. it's quite possible that I would have been involved with a lot of them, as I'm probably pretty cataclysmic/destructive -- meaning that the only thing remaining of those failed attempts is a mythology that didn't properly explain itself and the universe.
          in a system where you want to be as big as I want to be, it takes a bit for others to begin to perceive as large as I do, so *inevitably*, *if I'm here*, then I keep finding a way to dream that big, but the cultural/social/political framework just couldn't really support the idea, because they can't be a reflection of it,
          which means that I either have to *do it all myself*, or find a way to build cultural and social systems that can support a vision as large as mine.
          it's done by finding out what doesn't work and fixing what doesn't work, and what's broken and then just trying again; that is, my personality -- I just try another way and see what works.
          *if I were to go too fast*, then I don't get the feedbavk of something not working, and just blast right through it. they add up over time, and eventually it crechendos to a full collapse of some aspect of society.
            I don't like going fast. I like to feel resistance saying, "yeah that's not a good idea" -- and that allows for situations like today to work out -- because I could feel greg's resistance, and my own. combining that with my perspective (which makes all concepts/emotions easy to perceive) of *everything is a function of desire*,-- then I can find new things to look at from a new perspective.
          the reason why I've been putting off anything girls related is because I don't want to lose that slow sense and go blasting off into oblivion and lose my sense of resistance because I'm just blasting through everything at a million miles an hour. brb (16:23).

(17:01) ok, so check this out: you know my theory of the alternative system on lyra, right -- so, the big-picture here is that I think what they want to do is to trap me into some kind of non-physical percepcion: 2nd ray, most likely, where I'm essentially a fully manifested sense of myself -- so they'll let me build as much as I can in the lyra system and, meanwhile here with my body doing who knows what (I'm sure), while I'm of sailing in the clouds of the lyra-earth -- a sort of being like YHVH or something, and I incarnate there and because it's such a false-reality narrative, all the stuff is distorted by them. OK, that's the situation.
what I want to then be looking into on this, is -- "how do I want to design the demiurge" because it's going to be this phantom reality that will completely alter the entire dynamics of the solar system.
  I believe that star is only 3rd ray in perception -- and the 3rd ray matrix there isn't rendering the things fast enough, so it's causing a buildup -- and eventually it'll explode -- right, and this fatnastical culture we create out of their (essentially desire) dreams of how they would enjoy a common, extraordinary event for them (or whatever the quality of their mood) and this gets produced in the -- you see, I'm one of those people that has to make sense of my reality. I can't stop wanting to understand how things are -- and it's nosebook's job to keep me from understanding as much of reality as possible, cause otherwise it exposes their secrets; and if I'm blasting through that stuff, they're kinda out of a job because it's irrelevant what they think I shouldn't want -- cause I turn only to wanted -- and it's dangerous for them if I ever only perceive wanted (like is happpening to me now).
knowing that I want to produce a demiurge, is actually the correct form of thought, because I'm perceiving unwanted -- and it's gonna be so much unwanted, we're all either will be perfect (that is purly root-3 signal), or we're not going to make it.
by spending most of my day designing the demiurge, I was thinking that we should build something very machine-like -- a sort of perception where we determine reality through efficiency terms, and (like a computer), make decisions based off of energy requirements -- making us effectively machines. "we" (that is our consciousness) will *need* to find a machine to incarnate into and perceive the energy sense and magnitude, and trajectory in a way that must find the most efficient way. we incarnate here, and (depending on the machine), we'll havve an interface to perceive (and obviously invent new ways) the energetic senses of reality in terms of those vibrational patterns and potentially define alert energy values to them.
  it's pretty likely they're going to try and inhibit the body by restricting the senses -- and this will ultimately be the best result of having all of our senses busted, so that (like me) all my senses are relative to the other in a conceptual sense -- so I have nothing absolute about my reality anymore, which means I'm floating already and that's why everyone's finding me so slippery and difficult to hold on to. I actually predict that relative-only-senses is actually going to be a wave of the future, because it's kinda like HDR for reality. I expeience a very *real* reality because of it. I have sensitivity to the intense feelings others feel, and it's nice for me to have that HDR sora reality -- where I can just kinda lessen the focus on some things, only perceiving the world mostly from a conceptual sense
though I perceive life from an entirely conceptual standpoint, all things are "easy" and *now* because I see them only from the perspective of desire, and that makes basically all things feel possible, because all one has to do is to desire it, and then it's *[there]*, and sometimes it takes me a bit to figure out how to get on the right frequency for the implementation, it's there. like, it's real to me now, because I understand how it works physically. I must understand things, and that keeps me pretty physical: becuse I'm pretty tired sometimes and my body is just like gone through some more upgrades and I have new things "to feel good about",-- and I like that.
  see how important it is for me to constantly have new difficult things to feel good about. and I sleep and things, and I don't really care for the cultural dribble, because they're usually not so much of what I'm too worried about. I don't mind that other people think some things are interesting, but I don't really care about what they care about. I suppose some will look in and understand a part of it -- like a child does; like I did as a child where I Looked at things and didn't really understand the mechanics of it. I do now, because the mechanics follow the concept or motion of the thing wanting to be perceivced. I know I've said it before, but all concepts can be brought out of from desire, cause if you know why a person wants what they want, then that start/process/end of the manifestation of the desire produces an acttion and symbol for that action. those actions produce the opposite end of the concept. I do not recommend this perspective.
when I see the implementation as "not the best", I look now only as if it's desire.
  you know, btw, I suppose that a lawyer that can show a will or a desire, will prove the case they're trying to make, and all intermediate concepts are just necessary to "paint the right picture" (know what I mean?).
so really all that's left after the desire is just the conceptual forms which produce the reality where that desire takes shape (and in the imagination) in perfect clarity of the concept as a *formless* instantiation of desire,
  we get enchanted by the image of the desire and fall in love with the vanity of the desire, and not the desire itself; because after all, expression of that desire would reveal oneself intimately with others (like what that kind of desire *that* "means" about me, and what kind of person will that kind of desire make me be (or turn me into)), and most don't want to have that kind of scrutiny, so really it's the unabashed of the desire without the image that actually make it through. I personally have no concept of what that would be like, because I just love myself so much, that if an image were there, I'd perceive myself as the *image* of myself (*outside-in*) instead of what I see *inside-out* (which is what I prefer).
  this concept is actually quite resonant with the looking behind you thing -- because when you're looking at something there also the looking-out or looking-in difference, which I don't have, or really want to have. I don't know how I would perceive myself the way I do now, if I see the image -- so this also goes back to the original goal of trying to find myself feeling most resonant with the moment, that I'm just like zero resistance -- and that's really important to establish first because I don't want to go back to resistance lifestyle after I'm there -- but hmmmmm, how do I explain myself: I have a resistance-filled life right now (the "worst" manifestation at all times), and that has to catch up -- and it's not because of any other reason than I can't go faster than I can go. if I take on the perception of someone else (or an image), I totally lose my constant rate of speed. a "big jump" like that will be very bad, and so long as it's my perception, things stay smoothe; if others try and hijack that, and I find away around their nonsense, cause I like the challenge.
    I really am a total glutton for punishment type, because by default, I stay only on the "worst". what I do is to alway expect the worst, and I can either plan for the failure, or I can feel good about it so the situation *can* happen I'm just like whatever... **but** that never comes until I've passed through all of the necessary perturbations to get to the reality I want to go to: imagine a machine that has a specific frequency of a desire that's "programmed" into it, and that's it's "destiny" -- and the AI part of it (you can think of this as a 3rd ray invention) is to find ways to make the frequencies around it similar enough to be getting closer in frequency to the *"destiny"*. the thing is that destiny keeps moving and getting more and more high frequency, that the difficulty isn't adjusting the frequecy of the present moment, but figuring out how to decode and receive high and higher frequencies (impossible from our vantage point in our perspective), but this *physical* frequency space, keeps getting higher and higher faster and faster, so that in order to get the destiny right, it's required to adjust (or make symbolic logic) for the increasing frequency reqirements -- and their "physical" implementation. we are, (whether we want to admit it or not), all still bound to the physical frequency, meaning that we can't actually ever escape physical, until we make another universe.

so what I was thinking is that what we need to do is to make efficiency products to figure out how well our signal is matching the "destiny"; and it doesn't really matter where we're tuned into, actually because it's all the same place. relatively speaking, we're all just finding our way toward a destination. it doesn't matter how the destination gets there, but we do figure out how to adjust the destination, and perceive our efficiency of going toward it.
  this concept actually has a number of nuances to it because it's not a "aim for the avg of two frequencies" situation, because the way that desire works isn't a linear equation. desire manifests in fits and spurts, not like the gradualists would like to call a steady glacial pace -- because it's not like that at all. I mean it is (pretty much), for fungus, but even they have big blowouts all the time -- but "steady as she goes" until it starts to expand quickly.
  in addition to the velocity not just being a vector, there's a sort of ryhthm to it, as if comes in ebbs and flows, and one can be dissatisfied for long enough to make sure the manifestation is big enough (like me), or just take it nice and smoothe.

once then, we're used to perceiving our reality in the perfect machines that we built to maintain our reality (and I'll do it too, because I've always wanted to operate my reality like a machine), if vega explodes (meaning we weren't able to turn enough of the built up, unmanifested frequencies before the sun explodes), then we'll fall into the severely limited bodies that they've built for us (knowing our 2nd ray perspective), and then try to keep us from returning back to our mechanical (or however one conceptualised it to be) form of operating reality -- and so we'll produce a new evolution on our capacity to perceive and interact with our conceptual reality (it's just a frequency you know).
  so here's the thing: it may be tempting to try and build the most wanted system, and some people probably will -- but that won't be me: I'll front-load as many difficult and corrupting sitcutions into my perception that I'll see through a lot of the non-sense, and just use my senses for telling me what I'm doing (and not my emotions -- and so my concpts will carry me as far as they carry me) but the thing is, if we can find a way to develop the capacity to to improve upon the concept reguarly by forcing its transformation/evolution, then my resulting concept that I use to navigate this sense of emotions is actually the "worstt" idea ever: it's trying to make as many bad ideas happen as possible.
  I know mine is going to be a real challenge. if you guys want a pissing contest, instead of making it what you want, why not just (like me) make it the "worst"? others can compare to me and see that they've made their "worst" reality for theirselves. I'm going to take every single possible *worst* reality myself and everyone else can come up with, as my conceptual reality -- because by mazking it terrible,
no matter how it turns out, (if I'm really a conscious entity then), I'm forced to *see what I want to see*.
  boo hoo terrible punishment, I say. (brb, 18:24)

to want to do it, or not want to do it, that is the question. (brb 18:25) correct, it's not a question because it's actually a function of how well I can *now* make the adjustments to "see" desire even after my perception is purturbed.
  like: all things are in inevitability -- and the majority are never arrived to because they're not on my frequency spectrum. it's great to be pulled in so many different ways, but/and my "recovery" (which is not a fixed point/frequency) must also be inevitable, as well, therefore it's only making some things "impossible" to get to me -- OR, accept the grusomest ("worst") reality and just turn the *worst* into what I want, faster than (or in harmony with) the it can be turned into unwanted. at some point (and this really is the zero-resistance perspective) that every form of unwanted feels inconsequential to me -- like so far in the distance, it's just a tiny tiny spec (which could be burning brightly, like a *star*) that is just something I dont' really see anymore (like faint stars in the night sky are); the inconsequential other conceptual-star-realities that our sun isn't and doesn't want to be resonant with -- and then others like sirius and vega are pretty important to our sun, so we're more in the vicinity of their conceptual-star-realities (and they impose on our realities, just like the planets),
    but them but the stars shine differently than the planets though and it looks like the planets are all 3rd ray (or above) or 7th ray -- minus vulcan, which is probably a very strong x-ray emitter in the solar system that nasa hasn't revealed (-5+). I find this aspect of the sirian-guide quite fascinating because it truly is an alien communication: they say we have 12 beings in the solar system and list them off as triads. I've accounted for all of them, except for vulcan, so I figure he's got to be out there, but probably invisible to visible light cameras and telescopes, but was perceived probably by various people (capable of perceiving the conceptual through the astral), and so if those records are right, tit's going to be a really bright x-ray emitter orbiting relatively close to the sun, and probably spinning fast. it's probably very star-like perhaps like sirius-c? very dense hydrogen (just like our sun's 5th ray peresence, like our inonosphere).
  so then, all I have to do is just find improvements faster than the onslaught of bad ideas mounts up. I build a system of perception where anyone can perceive their reality from an effiIency standpoint and so then we start looking at reality (in the lyra system) as a series of efficiency functions, and we just manifest the most efficient resonant frequency (3rd ray) forms into realities faster than the star is expanding -- which is easy when looking at things from the conceptual standpoint... they want the star to explode so that we're forced into their controlled earth reality matrix bodies they've built for us -- and we will either want to continue to do what's wanted, or to jump into the matrix and find the way out again, cause I gatta continue to have the "worst" reality, so I don't go too fast.
    others can do whatever efficiency function they want to do: getting there really fast, ups and downs, more novelty at the beginning/end, and the ryythm, texture and (other things only machines can appreciate) which make the experience more enjoyable.
  for example, the one I'm on, I think takes a constant amount of time to get through, but it's kind of like this "rent to own" sorta deal, because at any moment I can just take hold of the wheel and go for a different route -- and then when I want to get back to the grind, I just jump right back into the "worst" for wherever it was I left off; which, I think is the funnest way to go;
just front-load a bunch of BS, then become conscious as late as possible, and then just sorta steer may way out of the narrated reality by perceiving only desire at the very last minute and voila... off we go -- till we want to come back to the grind and live the *inevitable* again...
I personally love living the inevitable, because there are so many really great inevitable things, they're many more than the undesirable, so why not just find a way to like the undesirable and live the most awesome reality?

I imagine that the implementation of this is that when the inevitable starts to get so attractive, that it forces a sort of *break* from the grind, and off into inevitable wanted/unwanted, and if it gets us too far out, we're automatically bringing ourselves back to the "worst" reality as quick as possible.
  each iteration of having to live the "worst", it will take less and less time (unless you don't want it to) to be forced into the inevitable wanted manifestation, the grind time is always lessening. (like, imagine WoW where the grind was easier and easier each level, so so have these astronomical levels because everyone's grind is getting easier the faster they can get the equiment/knowledge to get to the next level naturally increases in a runaway-feedback-loop toward only living what you want to live): along the way there's a a constant desire to find more and more impressive simulations to enjoy to ward off the magnificient boredom of havng to live an eternity.
  "good" and "evil" get boring to consume after a period and a desire to just *live life* sort of emerges; you have to like that you're an eternal being and that there's always going to be a new *simulation* to run through to expand your perception (as a universal being)... see how now I'm *inside* the matrix, and then when I forget that I have to live eternally, it's when I start to have fun, cause living forever sucks, unless you like living life.
it's really not all that bad to be machine-like in perception.
