# git

### 2023-05-19 16:19 - almost 40m to happy-hour

there are a lot of commands in vscode that I think I can access, and so I think I just want to start out with a vue that puts a button for the command that I want to see

## progress

- make vue component that displays all of the vscode git commands, like this: [git] -> [branch] -> [rename] -> [new name][v][x]


```vue
import * from vue
// ...
```
