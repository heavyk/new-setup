### 2023-09-02 03:25 - two (or more) paths

I figure I'm at a ttime in my life when I need to seemingly decide between two paths: stay with 1st ray perception, or drop down into 2nd ray perception for a while, essentially to create the thing that I have to conquer: the demiurge.
  what I mean by this is a simple calculation: if I go for 2nd ray perception, then I'm always going to be looking for the "best" or "worst" (comparative analysis) situation/thing/whatever. that perception is always relative and so therefore it's naturall (for me anyway), to always look for and desire the "best" -- no matter if it is, in fact, the best for everyone else. I'm extremely 1st ray in that perception already, mostly because I look for the best in comparison to itself (or some other inert/static/ideal comparison) like, "is this an improvement?" or, "would I like this more?" -- and not actually comparing myself to other people but only ripping off their good ideas ("rip people off shamelessly", right) -- so even in 1st ray perception, I'm still a bit 2nd ray.
  however, here's the thing: if I *really* want to be 1st ray in perception (while perceiving) 2nd ray, I should be designing all of the illusions/things that will inevitably come to defeat me: like imagine for example there was this terrible terrible force that was constantly holding me back -- and so my only choice is to find out how to feel the way I want to feel so that their holding me back, no longer bothers m5.
so, if I take the (blue?) pill, then I get all of the things that I want, because now I've converted over to the comparative perception -- or, I take the (red) pill, and stop caring what anyone else says or thinks, until I can finally find a way to feel the way I want to feel. I'm obviously going to take the latter.
  the amount of sexual innuendo (or similarity to sex) is astounding, and one of the things that I just don't like about sex at all, is that I have to feel like I have to hold back what feels good for prolonged periods of time, and that just isn't me at all. I'm like a star, and I desire to radiate constantly and stably.
    imagine for a moment what it would be like if a star were forced to be in that 2nd ray position where it's got this battle going on, and it has to hold back for some time before finally letting in what is desired (like sex) -- well, that's one way to do it. I'm not really like that, and so even the thought of sex in that way, where it's a huge buildup, and then release, I really don't like that. as a star, I like the idea of being such a constant emitter, I'm basically invisible (or part of the ambience).
  just imagine for a moment what it would be like if suddenly I became a person that suddenly had to start withholding wanted ideas/thoughts/whatever -- as, if they were to happen, it would suddenly become too much, and all of a sudden things start to explode (like one of those "mininovas") -- well, that's the kind of person that likes the attitude that it takes when it comes to sex.
I don't really want to take either pill honestly, because there simply isn't any reason to rush anything, because there's really no time pressure at all; there's only my readyness. if I just hold out (not on the good feeling) until I'm good at feeling the way I want to feel, then I accomplish both perspectives at the same time, because I become a stable emitter, and can therrefore output what I want to output, and not have the battle between wanted and unwanted raging, where wanted (explosion) *always* occurs (cause wanted/good always wins).
  this is kinda the whole "crux" of the entire thing here, because pure-desire is essentially the same as pure-evil (because it always wants more), and so therefore it *has* to have more, which is always going to be defeat (cause unwanted is the greatest source of wanted/expansion/enabling, freedom/growth/joy) -- so while 4 and 6 are dim and very dim reflectors, 2nd ray perception is quite reflective (like mirrors focusing a laser), so t...
  what's the problem here is that "evil" and "good" are both perceptual, and so therefore are both amplified -- and so pure-desire gets "defeated" by the "good" (calculated desire), because they can are *always* outdated perceptions of that desire, and so therefore, the desire is always going to be out of reach, and can never be interacted/measured/perceived directly -- so whatever the gap is from the 2nd ray's symbolic interpretation of the desire and the real-time updated/evolved form of the desire, is the "evil" that "defeats" the good, *causing it to become more/evolve* (of course, because evolution is inevitable)
my goal would then be, to find a way to stay in that always up-to-date 1st ray perception of things, which is an *emotional* form of perception, because I'm either finding a way to feel more like how I want to feel, or less -- sure, sometimes there are lower moments (defeats), which cause a more evolved desire to become, so those should be encountered as often as possible.
  I actually believe that it's desirable to have those defeats more and more rapidly per time increment, simply because that just means a higher frequency -- which means that the ultimate 2nd ray perception is to have as many defeats per time increment, as possible.
therefore, the objective, must be if I were to gain 2nd ray perception, will be to build up my "enemies" to the point that they're increasingly more and more able to often defeat me (thereby increasing my frequency, causing that expansion).
*OR*, I could just stay "trapped" in my chrysalis, allowing my enemies to power up, defeating me as often as possible, until I'm fully able to feel the way that I want to feel, accomplishing both 2nd and 1st ray perception ,effortlessly :) (effortlessly)

### 2023-09-09 02:12 - measure for measure

over in blahblog, I've been complaining about a number of different events that have happened in m/ life. in addition to those, I've had a number of new events that have happened since, such as the specific weeds that I ran an experiment on getting pulled up, when there's no way that anyone could have even known that I performed the experiment, and why those specific weeds were pulled up in the middle of a whole bunch of other weeds tells me that there is definitely something happening where my experiments are being targeted.
  I've been trying to figure out *why* someone is specifically targetting experiments that I'm making, and why do they seem to be so against me doing certain specific things. I honestly cannot find a pattern to it, and there is seemingly no explanation for it either. the important thing to note here is that this is my brain trying to figure out these action patterns and what the desire is behind it, so it's 100% 2nd ray perception (ie, the 2nd path -- in the previous entry).
what I do know for certain though, is that the events, no matter how confusing they are, *are* attracted, because they manifested (that's my thing anyway: "it's *all* attraction", right?) however what I cannot fully understand though is how I'm attracting these events.
  for me, when I'm combining weeds and trying to make a different type, or new weed with modified attributes, it feels just as inert of an action as mixing paint colours, or something like that. I don't feel like I'm gaining any power, authority, or any conditional way to feel good -- cause if my actions were trying to gain any of those things, then I can say for certain that my own desire to not have power, authority, or a conditional way to feel good (ie, the first path), then I would be the one attracting their sabotage with my own desire.
  in the case that it's just another situation where I need to find a way to feel good, no matter the circumstances, then I guess I'm probably doing pretty good, because I didn't even really feel upset or anything -- mostly just cOnfusion about why someone is so interested in destroying my hybrid weeds (which are usually an improvement on the previous ones), as they're literally, not a threat, and can only be seen as an improvement. nobody wants big ugly weeds, so why would anyone want to destroy the improved ones and leave the big ugly ones, is completely incomprehensible to me.
however, in the case that there really is, somewhere out there, someone that is actively trying to sabotage anything that I want to put any energy into, then that's a whole different thing entirely, and the subject of this entry... that would mean, then, that they're the ones that are doing the attracting, and they're essentially saying, "I want others to treat me this way" -- "I want someone to come and destroy the things that I've put my energy into"...

in an unrelated, but definitely related topic, one of the things that I've considered very strongly is that my time on this earth is actually a much bigger picture thing -- because I talk endlessly about how important it is to feel the way I want to feel, no matter the circumstances, -- and at the same time I say that words are not really all that effective at conveying a concept, as the way any concept *really* is understood, is through experience, which is best illustrated by example, because people can relate a lot easier to actions, than they can relate to words, so my example is really all that matters.
  the problem with my example though, is it's not the typical "high performance marketing" which is usually based around a reward system: do this, and you'll get a reward. so, for example, if I see an influencer/celebrity do a thing, and then I see them get a reward of something I would want, then I'm strongly motivated to copy the influencer/celebrity, so that I can have a similar reward; well, that's the opposite of what I do. I have no visible reward that would ever motivate anyone to copy me and try out feeling the way they want to feel -- because who in the world would want to be in the position that I'm in, where I have no friends, everyone lies to m5, and I live a very unglamorous life, where I basically do chores and housework and little else. not really an example that anyone would be really that motivated to follow...

so now, putting those two ideas together, what emerges, perhaps is that I'm fully committed (and therefore attracting) to situations that leave me entirely in a 1st ray perspective. if I go into 2nd ray perspective, then I'm in the business of showing people what is "good" and what is "bad" -- and providing a solution (or, a guide, lol) on how it's supposed to be done to get the "good" stuff, and avoid all of the "bad" stuff -- right? since I'm doing the opposite of that, I'm basically showing people, "hey, do this stuff, and your going to have to *actaully* figure out how you want to feel, because nobody will want to participate in your world" -- which provides an *enormous* market for all kinds of conditional solutions to come up, offering to people different techniques, machines, and conditions to feel a way without using their perception. I'm basically making it extremely easy for everyone to look at my "right way" and say, "naw, that's not for me... I'll stick to sex or music, drugs, or nosebook, or my imagination, or whatever -- just to avoid ever being shunned and rejected like that guy is".
  interesting, some reactions are wondering why I would think that I'm shunned -- well, I mean do you see *anyone* talking to me? I seem to be avoided at all costs, and it's not like anyone would actually want to talk to or associate with me. in my perspective, if *I* knew someone like me, I would have hundreds of questions to ask them, and would immediately try and do a number of different technology ideas, and stuff. I would be ecstatic that there is actually a person that understands how things work, and/or can can figure it out...
    in my past, and at every lecture I go to, I often times have a number of questions and comments for the presenter if they have *any* meat at all in their presentation. I'm always trying to figure out and reveal more and more of reality -- yet everyone else seems that they wayt to have less and less revealed, and for more things to be kept a secret. one of my goals, is to make it possible for *all* knowledge and thoughts, and experience to be accessable by anyone (even outsiders), yet at the same time expanding diversity, because everyone experiences it from their own unique perspective.
      right now my latest idea on how to do it, is with genetics: everyone experiences the same cOncept from a sightly different angle in the pen-rose, and attracts the situations in real-life in order to gain the concept experiencially.
        as an example, if someone wanted to learn how to have 1st ray perception, they may find themselves in a number of different situations where they are forced to superar their desire to know *how* (3) or *why* (2), and instead kknow *how they want to feel* (1). I guess that about sums it up :) I'll continue later...
