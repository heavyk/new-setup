### 2023-09-02 03:25 - two (or more) paths

I figure I'm at a ttime in my life when I need to seemingly decide between two paths: stay with 1st ray perception, or drop down into 2nd ray perception for a while, essentially to create the thing that I have to conquer: the demiurge.
  what I mean by this is a simple calculation: if I go for 2nd ray perception, then I'm always going to be looking for the "best" or "worst" (comparative analysis) situation/thing/whatever. that perception is always relative and so therefore it's naturall (for me anyway), to always look for and desire the "best" -- no matter if it is, in fact, the best for everyone else. I'm extremely 1st ray in that perception already, mostly because I look for the best in comparison to itself (or some other inert/static/ideal comparison) like, "is this an improvement?" or, "would I like this more?" -- and not actually comparing myself to other people but only ripping off their good ideas ("rip people off shamelessly", right) -- so even in 1st ray perception, I'm still a bit 2nd ray.
  however, here's the thing: if I *really* want to be 1st ray in perception (while perceiving) 2nd ray, I should be designing all of the illusions/things that will inevitably come to defeat me: like imagine for example there was this terrible terrible force that was constantly holding me back -- and so my only choice is to find out how to feel the way I want to feel so that their holding me back, no longer bothers m5.
so, if I take the (blue?) pill, then I get all of the things that I want, because now I've converted over to the comparative perception -- or, I take the (red) pill, and stop caring what anyone else says or thinks, until I can finally find a way to feel the way I want to feel. I'm obviously going to take the latter.
  the amount of sexual innuendo (or similarity to sex) is astounding, and one of the things that I just don't like about sex at all, is that I have to feel like I have to hold back what feels good for prolonged periods of time, and that just isn't me at all. I'm like a star, and I desire to radiate constantly and stably.
    imagine for a moment what it would be like if a star were forced to be in that 2nd ray position where it's got this battle going on, and it has to hold back for some time before finally letting in what is desired (like sex) -- well, that's one way to do it. I'm not really like that, and so even the thought of sex in that way, where it's a huge buildup, and then release, I really don't like that. as a star, I like the idea of being such a constant emitter, I'm basically invisible (or part of the ambience).
  just imagine for a moment what it would be like if suddenly I became a person that suddenly had to start withholding wanted ideas/thoughts/whatever -- as, if they were to happen, it would suddenly become too much, and all of a sudden things start to explode (like one of those "mininovas") -- well, that's the kind of person that likes the attitude that it takes when it comes to sex.
I don't really want to take either pill honestly, because there simply isn't any reason to rush anything, because there's really no time pressure at all; there's only my readyness. if I just hold out (not on the good feeling) until I'm good at feeling the way I want to feel, then I accomplish both perspectives at the same time, because I become a stable emitter, and can therrefore output what I want to output, and not have the battle between wanted and unwanted raging, where wanted (explosion) *always* occurs (cause wanted/good always wins).
  this is kinda the whole "crux" of the entire thing here, because pure-desire is essentially the same as pure-evil (because it always wants more), and so therefore it *has* to have more, which is always going to be defeat (cause unwanted is the greatest source of wanted/expansion/enabling, freedom/growth/joy) -- so while 4 and 6 are dim and very dim reflectors, 2nd ray perception is quite reflective (like mirrors focusing a laser), so t...
  what's the problem here is that "evil" and "good" are both perceptual, and so therefore are both amplified -- and so pure-desire gets "defeated" by the "good" (calculated desire), because they can are *always* outdated perceptions of that desire, and so therefore, the desire is always going to be out of reach, and can never be interacted/measured/perceived directly -- so whatever the gap is from the 2nd ray's symbolic interpretation of the desire and the real-time updated/evolved form of the desire, is the "evil" that "defeats" the good, *causing it to become more/evolve* (of course, because evolution is inevitable)
my goal would then be, to find a way to stay in that always up-to-date 1st ray perception of things, which is an *emotional* form of perception, because I'm either finding a way to feel more like how I want to feel, or less -- sure, sometimes there are lower moments (defeats), which cause a more evolved desire to become, so those should be encountered as often as possible.
  I actually believe that it's desirable to have those defeats more and more rapidly per time increment, simply because that just means a higher frequency -- which means that the ultimate 2nd ray perception is to have as many defeats per time increment, as possible.
therefore, the objective, must be if I were to gain 2nd ray perception, will be to build up my "enemies" to the point that they're increasingly more and more able to often defeat me (thereby increasing my frequency, causing that expansion).
*OR*, I could just stay "trapped" in my chrysalis, allowing my enemies to power up, defeating me as often as possible, until I'm fully able to feel the way that I want to feel, accomplishing both 2nd and 1st ray perception ,effortlessly :) (effortlessly)
