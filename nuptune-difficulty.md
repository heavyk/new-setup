### 2023-06-26 22:11 - initial ideas

I was thinking about how I want to become, because the whole thing is for *me* to become the DNA as we're going along. like I'll be one prototype, and then more will come, and they'll build model DNA and morph into that new DNA structure (like a genetic upgrade system). I'll select changes that I want to make for myself, cause I'm becoming the species model figure as we're designing it. others will join, obviously and we'll slowly change over vast majorities of humans to become these DNA as they opt into it (like no pressure, you know (wink wink)). like, it's got to be cool to join and stuff. I'm sure for them those things will involve the pinecone, and that's great, but I'm a species that doesn't have that, so we have screens/sensors that render into a grid array (or something even more stable than that) they'll see basically infinitely and build virtual cosmetics to show up on top of the zillions of atoms that they'll see (a sort of video filer) -- and that'll be personally customisable
  each of this considering as being an upgrade, however I've thoughtt a lot about change, and if you want a sepecies that doesn't have a lot of change, it's going to be more pleasurable, and also minimal unwanted, because unwanted produces change/novelty, so we stick to simple implementation of a "constant" (in our habits/tradition) to maintain very slow change, because they're just running at "peak" already -- like, why change something that's been cruising for billions and billions and billions of years of course
    (they'll all start out thinking they've already been around for that long (noble-lie), right -- the hardware infallable, but we'll notice many fails in software that'll need bugfixing/updates as well)

one other way to think about it is, when the species officially starts, is when other people join it -- and I suppose we could think of that as a sort of "wedding" -- a slow rollout wedding :)
