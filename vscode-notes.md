- it'd be cool to have key sequences: I want to type a 3 key sequence, not chord: (fn+, fn+,, fn+,, for one).
  I wonder if I could do this with an extension.
  I'd want wildcards (regex expressions to test the char): ctrl+z [a-zA-Z] (perform undo and write the letter it matched (plus Oops! to annoy yourself))
