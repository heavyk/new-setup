# affirmative-body-lotion

affirmative body lotion is a brand that ensures skin will be more firm and/yet desirable. it promises that one can have god-like skin with the use of the lotion.

affirmztive action body lotion takes a different route: it's got a strong motto of "it makes stuff work" in one part, in another, it's "always right", "really, try it out, and you'll see that everything is working like a miracle charm." (etc). anway, the lotion's mazin focus is the image associated with these producets. as much as I want to use real juicy men and women, I want to use strong sexually suggestive images, while a perfectly ratinal discussion is happening about how this miracle lotion solved *all* the problems -- in an ever so blatant 80's brainwashing sort of joke. it's a joke on assertive men at the same time as being ready for their arrival. the commercials should constantly convey the arrival of strong and calm and -- well you get the point :)
