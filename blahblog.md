### 2023-07-24 14:55 - conditions

I've been thinking a lot lately about a lot of stuff, which is why I haven't been writing as much; specifically, the narrative about the INFECTED ONES. (more on that later)

I've wondered a bit why on earth I'm here on earth -- simply because I'm in a place where, I noticed recently, that it's simply *not possible* for my ideas to ever see the fruition here -- and the reason is simple: my ideas reflect a form of thought which not many others have, and is also considerably lower resistance than most.
  because most people are much higher resistance than I am, the technologies that I want to create would provide them with the ability to simply not need to worry about what they're attracting, simply because the tech conditions of lower resistance can compensante for their higher resistance.
    one example of this is dating websites: when a person is having a difficult time finding the partner they're looking for, it's *always* because they're attracting something that they don't want. along comes the dating website and they say, "using our website, you can just select from the offerings and use your brain to do tthe attracting instead of your conceptualisation of the person/gender/type you want to attract" -- and they provide all sorts of different things that allow for someone to both search and display only certain more desirable aspects.
    another example would be a computer: we use it as a tool to build things, yet the great pyramid is a testament to the capabilities that one can accomplish without such tools -- and I find it pretty likely that the creator of the pyramid did most of the work in their mind, long before any stones were moved. the computer offers the person who is not capable of such powerful foresight to architect something in a similar way (I know, it's the construction bit that's the difficult part, not the architecture; because a greater pyramid can probably be designed in a CAD program today). the computer now enables us to design and concEptualise things that, in the past, only (low-resistance) god-like men could perform in their mind.
  therefore, I'm essentially prevented from ever creating any technological things that would allow anyone a significant shortcut around what they're attracting -- what I mean by this is that technology can *only* reflect our vibration and resistance levels. if our technology outpaces our resistance levels (similar to how it was in the stone age), then we're accumulating a more and more dissonant vibration even though we're still artificially feeling good.
    anyone who's done an amphetamine will know that, even though I'm able to stay awake, resistance levels continue to rise, and though I feel good and everything I'm actually making everything worse; the same is true for technology: technological/artificial stimulants cannot overcome accumulating resistance because of poor conceptualisation.
when I made this realisation, I was potentially a bit sad, because I'm really not trying to make the technology for anyone else other than myself, and it's all a reflection of me anyway, so it's not like I'm using it as a way to get around what I'm attracting (now anyway, though that may not have been true a decade ago). I'm also not trying to use the technology to *save* anyone, either -- as, I simply don't have any interest in trying to make anyone's life any different than what they're attracting already; just, it's a bit annoying that I live in a world where technology is shared (cause I want cool and awesome people to find and use my stuff too), which means that other peoples' vibrations are preventing the technology I want to use from coming out...
  because I'm limited by what others are attracting, I believe that's actually why I've intuitively changed over from wanting to create technology, to wanting to go instead with genetics -- because I feel that the human genetics that we're using now worked well for a time when there simply wasn't a way for us to communicate globally like we do now -- which means that now, it's considerably more obvious the effects of attraction, yet when we were in living in low population counts, often times in relative isolation, the effects of LOA were much lower. nowadays, with everyone connected and a much higher population density, the effects of LOA are considerable more notable. with a globalised society, it's possible to have a revolution in genetics.
    you'll also notice specificallly that the species that I want to create does *not* make it easier for someone to get around what they're attracting, but actually makes attraction become so fast, that what they think (and therefore feel) manifests nearly instantly, and consequently is also how they reproduce, as well.
    I aim to make LOA *more* of a think, rathar than less. I also wish to make attraction fun and more of a game where everyone can go at their own pace.

it's fully possible that someone could take the species that I want to make, and use large parts of it -- because if the genetics are storing a symbolic representation of some desired attribute, and can produce the frequency to attract it, it's also possible to just make the body vibrate like that, even though the person has not accomplished the frequency mentally -- and sure, it's also possible to use all of the same stuff still with a pinecone, which could give some pretty major advantages to those that do it -- that's not the thing; for me, I just want to have a race where I can incarnate into the body *without* a pinecone (and also encounter others that also don't have a pinecone)
  the idea here is that the species that I want to create is essentially invincible in the sense that even the most energetic experience (sex), doesn't really modify the percption of the body, and so even if I were to interact with someone with a pinecone, sexually -- it still wouldn't modify my perception (because my desire/attraction is so much faster, that its effect feels nothing more than a gentle breeze).
    this means that *all* things are a reflection of my perception -- so you could imagine the species (because attraction is so fast), has a bit of a learning curve to it, and large portions of society (or the social-cultural-famework) will probably need to be updated (for reasons I demonstrate frequently).
      when a person manifests what they think and feel quickly, they need to start attracting what they *actually* want, otherwise society descends into chaos a bit and "the world as I know it" comes to an end (speaking from experience).
        it's quite possible that there is a bit of a thing here where the controllers are actually doing good work, simply because they're kind of like setting the bar for attraction, by keeping everyone in astral and assulting them constantly with unwanted circumstances; and until the person is actually starting to attract what they want, they'll remain in the human condition.
      one of the things I've thought about on this, is what it would be like if someone with high resistance were to have a similar genetics to my own -- and what it would be like for them. they would manifest their desires really quickly, probably in the form of fear (because of their resistance level), and they'll be stuck living out all of their worst fears.
        one example of this may very well be jaron, as he's quite similar to me in how he is, but because he has considerably higher resistance than I do, he's having a much worse expeirence.
    therefore, it's actually quite possible that nosebook is actually a *wanted* thing, simply because there's no possible way that I could ever expect all of society to change and everyone around me to start attracting what they want, just so I can create my species (and then hopefully later some technology) -- but we'd have to essentially live on separate worlds, where all the good tech and the inspect species is in one place, meanwhile the other place is still filled with humans.... so actually, I may not be in a worse spot than I thought.
  it's possible to create hybrids as well, because for me, the goal is to figure out how the different layers?/forms of perception operate with the physical genetics, and I also find it'll be quite normal for human women to give birth to these hybrids as well, which will be very interesting because then they can *really see* (and interact) with a reflection of their own perception.
what anyone else does with tthe genetics (and the corresponding understanding) that I produce, really isn't any of my business (or problem), as everyone else is still attracting everything, as they are. they'll get the consequencEs of their own attraction. genetics can not compensate for rising resistance/dissonance, and neither can technology.

### 2023-07-24 16:57 - a second species is also in the works

I noticed that in addition to the insect species, there is also a plant species that is being created, which is in itself an idology built on top of "it's all attraction" -- where we're essentially just like plants: we make the things come to us.
it's kind of a software thing more than a hardware, where now with everything being "it's all attraction", then everytthing is a reflection of me (and my attraction), but in addition to that, I function as a centre, a point of consciousess that is focused in a way where *everythingv is my cconcept of how it is, ardound me".
that's a pretty serious claim, as well because I now exist like a star, which is forever; if others learn to see everything around tbhem as a reflection of theirself, they don't need to worry as much about what they're attracting, because most of the output is in a frequency range which powerfully transforms the world around them. it's a pretty serious thing to think that with a slight conceptual adjustment in our world view, things will never (ever) be the same again: we're all centres, so it doesn't matter what anyone else is doing.... you don't need to be attractive, if 666 you're repulsive to everyone else in their perception, then you're a centre. you're in your own world, and there's nothing anyone else can do about it.
this species, of course the plants' conceptual side.
the reason why we're so repulsive is because we're so attractive to *only* what I want; others can join me, but I'm in my own world; everyone else can just figure it out just like I did: I'm glad that nosebook exists, and that all of thesxe difficulties that have come from getting my pinecone removed, I just love to be highly attractive, and anything that happens around me, *is* something that was attracted, which means I "see"/feel my interpretation of what everyone else is attracting, according to *my* social-cultural-framework, and so, in thta II'm
an individual.
I'm a plant.
I'm a weed.

more like a weed.

I just noticed that my commit messages are strongly encoding a sort of demiurge as well, because when I say "boom haedshot" or "better conclusions", then I'm specifically ttainting the work from the get-go, which is kind of a funny thing for some of the ones that that read those as some sort of insight into my emotional state, when in fact it's actually just a really fufny ffjoke to see what sort of outlandish thing to write. I just write it cause it feels fun... I dont' mean any harm. #demiurge

### 2023-07-244 17:20- the insects and the plants

are a bit of a role reversal, because the insects are stationary, and it's the plants that move around.
  yet, they're both centres, which means that one is a hardware ccentre, and the other is a software centre; but they're both centres, which means live forever, essentrelyy.
  we're not human anymore, not because of our hardware, but we're actually different now because of our *software*; and this is the part that works, because as a very attractive person; we're going to need to make easy decisions about what a thin[kg] and what does it *do*. things that exist *sdo* something; they perform a role for someone somewhere to have needed. notice that the rocks exist because we builder humans have need a foundatione to build things on.
  as all things work out the way they do, the result of LOA is a whole lot of beliefs, and the way that we look at something (ie, conceptualise) builds these -archetypes- that neeed to exist, and each one performs a -_role_. for the other, because he's extent just, like the rock.
  and roll insects,
  who you gonna plant?
lol.
  how many lines wide is this anyway? ------------------------------------------------------
  that many, I say.
  I hope I remember to insure the docuent stays at the same width;
  if it changes that, would be bad.
  ass like, country mike.

### 2023-07-28 08:55 - decisions

yesterday was an interesting day for me because I had another very unexpected thing happen: usually when I want to remember something, I put the idea into the front of my mind a couple of times, and use the idea in a sentence or two (like writing here, or remembering someonee's name) -- and then later on when I want to remember the idea, I simply conjure the feeling, and I can remember the thing/name/idea again.
  this allows me a whole host of really cool things that I can do with my mind, simply by accessing the idea through a feeling (exactly like memory). one of them is that I can create lists of things that I want/need to do (though usually want works better than need), and all I have to do is to simply feel what I want to do next and the next idea I want/need just comes to me (see why want works better than need?). at the end of the list, I simply *feel* like I'm done, and that's it.
so yesterday, I had been instructed to ensure that the rain gutter thing is put back because if it rains, it'll flood their basement. I fully understood the problem before she even told me about it, as it seemed pretty obvious to me, so I know it's important. I even practised to put the rain gutter back in my mind and planned to do it...
then, paul shows up and I can no longer blow out the front part with the blower (to not hit his truck with debris), so I decided I was done for the day. I went back to put everything away and noticed that I can return the stack of rocks to be around the window again, so I started to do that.
I'm having fun putting the rocks back and have designed a wave sort of pattern to give the lump of rocks some shape. as I continue on, the motors are getting louder and more frenzied, but I keep ignoring them because I'm having fun doing it (and I kinda also want to get it done).
the rain clouds continue to get bigger and bigger, and at one point, I finally say, "fine I'll go now" because I had felt very strongly that I really should be leaving at this point (prolly cause it's gonna rain soon). I put the stuff away and I look right at the rain gutter and say, "seems good" -- cause I felt like I was done -- and then went home. I took a shower and made dinner and went to bed before I remembered that I hadn't put the rain gutter back. it probably flooded.
  I'd like to mention that a very similar event happened tuesday last week as well, where I needed to remember to put the trash on the street, and I practised it and made sure I would remember the idea and everything -- but by the time the motors are furious that I'm outside near the end of the day (for some reason they don't want me outside -- haven't figured it out why), that again I felt like I was done, took the dumpster back behind the house and went inside. the next day I woke up and realised I missed trash day.
these events, along with a number of other memory-related issues (I remember things based on how they feel), tells me that nosebook has been hijacking the way I feel in order to steer me, because I don't really perform actions in the same way that they (and a lot of other people do): which is through the symbolic (3) system, where each action has a consequence, and so the way that you convince someone (like a sales person) is to affect the way that they perceive the consequences (buy our product, and the consequence of your action is that you'll feel better about yourself).
  my system for actions is conceptual, and so therefore it's all about how I feel, because the action itself doesn't mean anything: I've noticed many people performing the same actions as me with *much* worse/better cOnsequences than I had (like smoking weed in front of policia) -- and the stuff that works well for me is because I feel "normal" about it, and not as if I'm doing something wrong. I also noticed that a lot of people (with money/power), don't seem to have the same consequences as everyone else -- and so I've come to the conclusion that consequences are a symbolic/literary concept that *only* exists because people like the idea of justice and consequences. all action is performed as a reflection of how I feel; so I can basically just feel, and let my body perform action (watch marc or the starcraft guys play -- and they just feel what is coming next and the body, especially the left-side, just makes the action).
so, even though nosebook is hijacking my system for making action, I still felt good about leaving the rain gutter, and also about not taking the trash out, and so really that's all that matters. I can't really do much other than that.
  it's like when I'm having a conversation with someone, and the other person expects me to behave a certain way, or is attracting something out of me that I don't really want to do -- well, when that happens, I always feel bad about the action, and so therefore interrupt my body to ensure that I don't perform the action that they're attracting,
so whatever ends up happening (no matter how awful it is), all I have to do is remember to feel good about whatever it was that happened, instead of perceiving the consequences (which is why I'm writing this, instead of over at remi's house).
  though that sounds like self-absolution from consequences, I still strongly adhere to the idea that *all* consequences are a literary/symbolic creation of our own mentation, and that looking a fair bit down the arrow of time, it seems fairly obvious that nosebook is playing with fire a little bit. we'll see what unforseen consequences they accrue on theirselves, by making things that otherwise wouldn't feel good, feel good (for other conceptual/insect-like beings, like me).

### 2023-07-29 08:30 - the new kingdom

this morning, I woke up thinking about how in times past, the powerful kings would import the daughters of rival kings to form a sort of alliance between the two kingdoms. the effect that this has vibrationally is quite an interesting one, if I consider that the X is a conceptual framework for perception.
  in other places, I've postulated that the X essentially stores a whole host of built-in (pre-installed) concepts that any person would want to have in order to be able to see/perceive physical. like, it contains the basic structure of the atom (adam) and how they're to be seen, the way that physics works, and so fourth; essentially, a conceptual model of how the physical universe works.
    the Y is the narrative/symbolic implementation, and is much smaller because you don't need a lot of code to encode LOA and other ideas like the "golden rule" or "ask and it's given" -- as these are pretty simple to represent symbolically when working with frequencies/concepts.
  I have also postulated that girls contain the entirety of this repository of concepts going essentiall all the way back to eve, and that the frequency of these concepts cancel each other out, leaving very little low frequencies (only the difference between her father and mother), and lots and lots of very high frequencies (desire) where the waveforms don't match up entirely.
  so, in short, I consider (XX) females to be a repository of pretty much all ideas that have existed all the way up until now, yet because the two X cancel each other out, the only real strong signal that is created is the one that her brain (which also behaves like an X) has focused/present in her mind (usually 5-7).
what this means is that (XX) beings essentially store a library of concepts and ideas, which -- my other theory is that the X is also a sort of network where all of them are connected, which means that not only are all humans connected (cause we all have an X), but also that females in close proximity to another begin to sort of "rub off" on one another and concepts that one has will start to become attracted into the space of others.
  this happens because, say one woman has a concept that another doesn't have -- though, they're canceled out for her, and so therefore probably not present in her brain, they're not canceled out for the other females/males in the group -- and so what I believe happens is that this starts an attraction process as nearby people begin to resonate with those new ideas, and therefore begin to attract them in. this is really good for evolutionary purposes, because the faster that one woman can assimilate the ideas of another (that is, integrate the opposite/same idea into her own X), the more rapidly evolution happens for that maternal line).
    I don't have any conclusive proof on this idea personally (I don't know if I'm XX genetically, or not), but I've noticed in m/ own life and others, that females (and myself) when they get around other females, they strongly affect the others with their new concepts and begin to attract the apparition of those novel concepts into others' realities as well. they also affect men strongly too (in a different way), because it starts attracting the thing, but the attraction comes through (or has to fit into) their symbolic narrative reality of how the universe works, and so a lot of men are closed off to a lot of ideas, simply because it they don't have a symbolic representation for the idea yet. (this is how inventions happen and desire works)
  as new Ideas are spread out, not all of the ideas are actually "good" ideas -- and some may even be seen as "evil" or "bad" in others perception (2)
    when I say perception, I'm referring to the Y, but also to the brain and also your source (those are the three major sources of perception), but I could also include any and all narratives that explain reality, including science and religion.
  the ideas that are recognised (that is they resonate with the perception/narrative), get canceled out, because they're understood and are therefore covered by the narrative. however, the ones that are not understood/covered, begin to get attracted -- and that's essentially how desire works: everything that isn't perceived in the big-picture (2), starts to get attracted more and more until the brain/Y/religion/etc can explain it.
what that means then, is that these kings, when they're importing the daughters of foreign empires, they're importing a lot of both good and bad ideas. for now, let's just focus on the bad ideas though and note that it was often these bad ideas that caused the downfall of so many kings and kingdoms. therefore, taking a step back, what it looks like, from the men's (Y) perspective, is that the only really successful king will be the one that is able to come up with a narrative for self and country that is able to perceive all of the ideas that he's imported (both good and bad), in a way which feels good and doesn't cause his downfall.
  I say "his" because I'm taking the traditional masculine/patriarchical perspective on this one because traditionally it's been the men that have come up with a narrative that can come up with a the-manual which can cohabit "peacefully" with (or maybe dominate with absolute power) so many bad ideas. I know that genetically it's quite possible for females to have a Y, and it's also quite possible for them to come up with narrative as well (many female writers have existed and come up with narrative), yet I postulate that the best way to do this, is *not* to come up with a narrative, and to skip that entirely because that's all based on action, and while action in a sequence *does* imply meaning, I've demonstrated over and over that the way one feels/conceptualises reality during the action/sequence *means* far more than the action itself. therefore, in order to create a narrative (2) that isn't purely symbolic (3) like all of the failed ones before it, the narrative (2) needs to account for both concept (5) and desire (1) as fundamental aspects.
    most narratives are ignore 5 and try to limit/constrain/steer 1 -- and those are the ones that seem to cause the downfall, simply because they're not general in understanding of attraction/desire and the emotional reflection of that attraction from my source's perception (2) of the entire-picture.

all kingdoms that fail to produce and therefore understand attraction of new ideas will continue to fail. the "new kingdom" (I'm trying to sound end-timesy) will be established on top of the narrative that can continue to go higher and higher frequency without getting overturned by its own desire to become something more than it is.
  there have been kingdoms that have lasted a very very long time (egypt for example), and they've lasted a long time because of their *rejection* of new ideas -- which works only for so long as the kingdom and its narrative remain more relevant than the new ideas are. I personally find this sort of big-picture to be pretty limiting, and anticpate that a big-picture tthat can explain "all" will be more like a fractal, which (once that fractal gets boring) will cause desire for a new fractal to be created -- and then the universe reinvents itself :)

### the INFECTED ONES
