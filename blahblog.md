### 2023-07-24 14:55 - conditions

I've been thinking a lot lately about a lot of stuff, which is why I haven't been writing as much; specifically, the narrative about the INFECTED ONES. (more on that later)

I've wondered a bit why on earth I'm here on earth -- simply because I'm in a place where, I noticed recently, that it's simply *not possible* for my ideas to ever see the fruition here -- and the reason is simple: my ideas reflect a form of thought which not many others have, and is also considerably lower resistance than most.
  because most people are much higher resistance than I am, the technologies that I want to create would provide them with the ability to simply not need to worry about what they're attracting, simply because the tech conditions of lower resistance can compensante for their higher resistance.
    one example of this is dating websites: when a person is having a difficult time finding the partner they're looking for, it's *always* because they're attracting something that they don't want. along comes the dating website and they say, "using our website, you can just select from the offerings and use your brain to do tthe attracting instead of your conceptualisation of the person/gender/type you want to attract" -- and they provide all sorts of different things that allow for someone to both search and display only certain more desirable aspects.
    another example would be a computer: we use it as a tool to build things, yet the great pyramid is a testament to the capabilities that one can accomplish without such tools -- and I find it pretty likely that the creator of the pyramid did most of the work in their mind, long before any stones were moved. the computer offers the person who is not capable of such powerful foresight to architect something in a similar way (I know, it's the construction bit that's the difficult part, not the architecture; because a greater pyramid can probably be designed in a CAD program today). the computer now enables us to design and concEptualise things that, in the past, only (low-resistance) god-like men could perform in their mind.
  therefore, I'm essentially prevented from ever creating any technological things that would allow anyone a significant shortcut around what they're attracting -- what I mean by this is that technology can *only* reflect our vibration and resistance levels. if our technology outpaces our resistance levels (similar to how it was in the stone age), then we're accumulating a more and more dissonant vibration even though we're still artificially feeling good.
    anyone who's done an amphetamine will know that, even though I'm able to stay awake, resistance levels continue to rise, and though I feel good and everything I'm actually making everything worse; the same is true for technology: technological/artificial stimulants cannot overcome accumulating resistance because of poor conceptualisation.
when I made this realisation, I was potentially a bit sad, because I'm really not trying to make the technology for anyone else other than myself, and it's all a reflection of me anyway, so it's not like I'm using it as a way to get around what I'm attracting (now anyway, though that may not have been true a decade ago). I'm also not trying to use the technology to *save* anyone, either -- as, I simply don't have any interest in trying to make anyone's life any different than what they're attracting already; just, it's a bit annoying that I live in a world where technology is shared (cause I want cool and awesome people to find and use my stuff too), which means that other peoples' vibrations are preventing the technology I want to use from coming out...
  because I'm limited by what others are attracting, I believe that's actually why I've intuitively changed over from wanting to create technology, to wanting to go instead with genetics -- because I feel that the human genetics that we're using now worked well for a time when there simply wasn't a way for us to communicate globally like we do now -- which means that now, it's considerably more obvious the effects of attraction, yet when we were in living in low population counts, often times in relative isolation, the effects of LOA were much lower. nowadays, with everyone connected and a much higher population density, the effects of LOA are considerable more notable. with a globalised society, it's possible to have a revolution in genetics.
    you'll also notice specificallly that the species that I want to create does *not* make it easier for someone to get around what they're attracting, but actually makes attraction become so fast, that what they think (and therefore feel) manifests nearly instantly, and consequently is also how they reproduce, as well.
    I aim to make LOA *more* of a think, rathar than less. I also wish to make attraction fun and more of a game where everyone can go at their own pace.

it's fully possible that someone could take the species that I want to make, and use large parts of it -- because if the genetics are storing a symbolic representation of some desired attribute, and can produce the frequency to attract it, it's also possible to just make the body vibrate like that, even though the person has not accomplished the frequency mentally -- and sure, it's also possible to use all of the same stuff still with a pinecone, which could give some pretty major advantages to those that do it -- that's not the thing; for me, I just want to have a race where I can incarnate into the body *without* a pinecone (and also encounter others that also don't have a pinecone)
  the idea here is that the species that I want to create is essentially invincible in the sense that even the most energetic experience (sex), doesn't really modify the percption of the body, and so even if I were to interact with someone with a pinecone, sexually -- it still wouldn't modify my perception (because my desire/attraction is so much faster, that its effect feels nothing more than a gentle breeze).
    this means that *all* things are a reflection of my perception -- so you could imagine the species (because attraction is so fast), has a bit of a learning curve to it, and large portions of society (or the social-cultural-famework) will probably need to be updated (for reasons I demonstrate frequently).
      when a person manifests what they think and feel quickly, they need to start attracting what they *actually* want, otherwise society descends into chaos a bit and "the world as I know it" comes to an end (speaking from experience).
        it's quite possible that there is a bit of a thing here where the controllers are actually doing good work, simply because they're kind of like setting the bar for attraction, by keeping everyone in astral and assulting them constantly with unwanted circumstances; and until the person is actually starting to attract what they want, they'll remain in the human condition.
      one of the things I've thought about on this, is what it would be like if someone with high resistance were to have a similar genetics to my own -- and what it would be like for them. they would manifest their desires really quickly, probably in the form of fear (because of their resistance level), and they'll be stuck living out all of their worst fears.
        one example of this may very well be jaron, as he's quite similar to me in how he is, but because he has considerably higher resistance than I do, he's having a much worse expeirence.
    therefore, it's actually quite possible that nosebook is actually a *wanted* thing, simply because there's no possible way that I could ever expect all of society to change and everyone around me to start attracting what they want, just so I can create my species (and then hopefully later some technology) -- but we'd have to essentially live on separate worlds, where all the good tech and the inspect species is in one place, meanwhile the other place is still filled with humans.... so actually, I may not be in a worse spot than I thought.
  it's possible to create hybrids as well, because for me, the goal is to figure out how the different layers?/forms of perception operate with the physical genetics, and I also find it'll be quite normal for human women to give birth to these hybrids as well, which will be very interesting because then they can *really see* (and interact) with a reflection of their own perception.
what anyone else does with tthe genetics (and the corresponding understanding) that I produce, really isn't any of my business (or problem), as everyone else is still attracting everything, as they are. they'll get the consequencEs of their own attraction. genetics can not compensate for rising resistance/dissonance, and neither can technology.

### 2023-07-24 16:57 - a second species is also in the works

I noticed that in addition to the insect species, there is also a plant species that is being created, which is in itself an idology built on top of "it's all attraction" -- where we're essentially just like plants: we make the things come to us.
it's kind of a software thing more than a hardware, where now with everything being "it's all attraction", then everytthing is a reflection of me (and my attraction), but in addition to that, I function as a centre, a point of consciousess that is focused in a way where *everythingv is my cconcept of how it is, ardound me".
that's a pretty serious claim, as well because I now exist like a star, which is forever; if others learn to see everything around tbhem as a reflection of theirself, they don't need to worry as much about what they're attracting, because most of the output is in a frequency range which powerfully transforms the world around them. it's a pretty serious thing to think that with a slight conceptual adjustment in our world view, things will never (ever) be the same again: we're all centres, so it doesn't matter what anyone else is doing.... you don't need to be attractive, if 666 you're repulsive to everyone else in their perception, then you're a centre. you're in your own world, and there's nothing anyone else can do about it.
this species, of course the plants' conceptual side.
the reason why we're so repulsive is because we're so attractive to *only* what I want; others can join me, but I'm in my own world; everyone else can just figure it out just like I did: I'm glad that nosebook exists, and that all of thesxe difficulties that have come from getting my pinecone removed, I just love to be highly attractive, and anything that happens around me, *is* something that was attracted, which means I "see"/feel my interpretation of what everyone else is attracting, according to *my* social-cultural-framework, and so, in thta II'm
an individual.
I'm a plant.
I'm a weed.

more like a weed.
