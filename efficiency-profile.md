### 2023-05-29 21:56 - I could get it from someone else...

> that person has something I want, so I can try to find a way to get it from them (or perceive myself to have an advantage),-- or, I could just get/become it myself.

### 2023-06-18 08:45 - lies and untruths

I noticed that when I have a conditional on my words, like "I should say this to this person" or "not say that to this person" -- then the thought takes an extra cycle in my brain before coming out of my mouth. however, if I speak directly from brain to mouth or from heart to mouth, then no cycles are lost and so therefore the words are more potent/powerful.
  the other thing I noticed when speaking myself and also lissening to others, is that when the thought (brain) or feeling (heart) takes extra cycles in the brain, the vibration of the voice picks up these conditional thoughts, and so (for example) if I'm worried that someone will find out about something that I'm not being truthful about, then my voice will contain the "feeling" (or sound) of those worried thoughts.
    in fact, this aspect of lissening is actually what's kind of the "tell" when someone is lying -- simply because their words contain other feelings than just the concept they're trying to convey. unless I'm familiar with the other concept(s) that their voice sounds/feels like, I don't usually have the ability to "look" into what they're really saying in the moment (cause I think kinda slowly) -- so often times, when I feel their words aren't fully their concept, then I just make an excuse to separate myself from the conversation and think about what they're really saying before taking them at their word/symbol (hearing them).
  another thing that I noticed when listening to people like myself and also to people like trump is that we often times repeat ourselves -- and that is because (IMO) the previous sentence ended on a feeling that wasn't quite the one that was wanted to be conveyed, and so we'll repeat ourselves to end on the "note" (concept) that felt important to convey.
in truth, because I think so slowly, I simply don't have the spare cycles to try and figure out what I should or shouldn't say, and so therefore I've removed a lot of my filters, and then just enjoy the pleasure of listening to myself say insightful things. there is no faster way to slow down insightful (resonant with tthe conversation and person) and enlightened thoughts, than to think too much about what the other person will think and how they'll react to what I'm saying.
I prefer to have general rules about things that I don't want to talk about prepared beforehand and in all other cases, just let it flow and pick up the pieces from the destruction later.
  as such, I've also gotten pretty good at smoothing over misplaced words, and because I speak usually directly from the heart (not often even thinking about it with my brain), people have found my words to be sincere, even if they got severely offended (which is always *their* problem, and *never* mine (even though society would have me think it's *my* fault for offending someone))
    obviously it's not my problem because they're the one that feels bad, not me. when they feel bad about something, that means that they're looking at it in a way that causes resistance (which is every offence)
      if I push on something, and it pushes back, that is resistance (saying I don't want to move) and that equal and opposite reaction can also be thought of as offence as well (pushing back against the thing).

### 2023-06-18 09:12 - being offended is a waste of energy

everyone has an opinion on everything, and there's no way that I can control what anyone else's opinion of anything is, so when someone shoots their mouth off and causes me to feel bad, it's *me* that feels bad, *not them* -- so I'm the one that's feeling the slowdown/resistance, not them.
  often times, it's common to try and return the offence by countering their attack with another attack to cause them to feel resistance and slow down as well (and that can be done -- or save the energy for another time to "get them" when they're not expecting it), but the fact still remains, which is 100% *my problem* -- is that their words (or actions) caused *me* to slow down and feel bad.
