# the-problem

men are advancing really rapidly, yet tit seems that some of them are not able to keep up with the expansion, still requiring a society with a lot of the old [sumerian-drawbacks](/sumerian-drawbacks.md) to continue to hang around. so, in order for men to be able to reach their evolutionary dreams, they've got to find a way to evolve the females in a stable way.
scientists have discovered that females are designed to remain at a constant frequency, and because the two X chromosomes run at opposite frequencies, it's impossible to send a nothing signal to get both cromosomes to change simultaneously, so they're essentially without technical repair.
  turns out that all attempts to try and change their perception ultimately result in massive clashes with the society/culture that she's in. they seem to transmit a sort of "reality frequency" (which comes from the canceled/self-destructed frequency between the XX) that's causing people around them to *see things the way they do*, and nobody likes that, cause so many beautiful/technical/mechanical things are misinterpretted or lableled as not important or even made to be *ugly* (including theirselves and people around them).
so, what scientists have done is to try and turn the pair into a triangle (or pyramid in 3d), where the two/four feet are expanded/moved simultanously, directed by the point/peak at the top. therefore, by directing  the expansion/contraction of the two, then the planet (top/bottom frequency dual) stays in an orbit that doesn't collide with other similar orbits (or non-orbited individuals).
