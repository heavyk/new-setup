### 2023-06-27 20:29 - general opinions

I don't really know what I want to talk about, so I decided I'm just going to do a general opinion on things. so, yesterday I was all hyped up about neptune-difficulty and stuff, but today I just don't really feel like trying to figure out how to coerce other people to do things. for example, when I saw remi today, I thought about whether I feel like I could make the new species happen, trying to align with remi -- but the thing is, even if somehow we were able to break through the communication barrier and start to work on something, there's still the enormous problem of ...
  you see, when I talk to remi about things that I can do with my mind, and things like that remi is a very close-minded person. I want to build a system that modifies DNA based on a person's perception and she's not even able to believe that cOncept is different than emotion, and sensation is not actually what you're feeling (conversations we had in the past), there's *no way* she's gonna understand or even try to comprehend anything that I/we'd be needing to talk about with the technology.
I can't make something that others don't believe is possible. I spend a lot of time trying to communicate clearly, and that's becasue when others can see the concept I have in mind, then they'll feel like they know it, and that can only be done when we have compatible frequencies.
  nosebook wants me to find a compatible frequency with a girl (ie, go down to her (manageable) level), instead of her finding her way to my frequency, instead. I know it sounds funny to say, but I'm in ZERO HURRY to lose my form of perception. I simply don't caze if others are incompatible with me because it's totally not my problem. I'm cruising where I'm at, and I like my world being this effortless. essentially, girl = matrix. I'm free to see things the way I want to see them, not like I *should* see them because the world has determined that whatever feels bad, and I have universal consciousness, seeing the entire universe as being this reflection of myself (you know, I often wonder if the galaxies way out in the distance don't have a physicality, just cause I can't see that far yet -- lol)
  there is alzo a bit of strange irony, because just yesterday I was saying the same thing about snake-bros and how we're on totally different frequencies as well, but for the complete opposite thing: even though we're still incompatible on a lot of other things, I know that kyle prolly gets like 90+% of the frequential stuff I'm talking about; he'd believe/grasp/"get" what I'm saying because I'm just doing my best to translate only one or a few angles into something comprehensible at a time. then, if either of us don't understand the rendering of the concept, I can just try a different angle and we can look at itt again.
    see what I'm saying? different people respond to me differently. I noticed that a lot of humans tend to stick to one or two different rays of perception, but I can use all 7, with varying capability. the imagination, I don't see my own, but I can tell I have an effect on others' imagination. I can project symbol like a magician, all of the rays (some better/different than others). every person *attracts* those "gifts" out of me, because we can communicate on the same frequency. I am acutely aware when someone is on the same frequency as me, cause when we're not, I can't understand or make sense of anything (which is nice because there's a lot of stuff out there that I don't care for). remi and family don't communicate with me clearly. I don't understand their *concepts* (they're more about symbol/meaning and action), so we simply don't have much in common, other than boilerplate interactions. it's totally fine though, I don't expect others *who cannot communicate with me*, to do so, cause it causes problems, because the person thinks I'm invading their mind and other paranoias (which are probably also true).
  when I was at marcos house (actually almost the entire time in spain, some exceptions), I encountered the same experience where everyone is communicating symbolically, and when I start doing what I do conceptually, they'd get really freaked out. I simply couldn't understand them, so I wanted to know what they were *really saying* (in the moment while they're talking, instead of having to wait until later to figure it out). they spoke and loved to look people in the eyes, because I think talking is a semi-visual experience.
    I found it very difficult to look people in the eyes because so often the concept coming out of their eyes (which I "feel"/sense and not see), did not at (at all) match their words. I had enough time figuring out what their words were saying, so to figure out what the emotion is saying, subtracting my own, and also communicating in a foreign language, meanwhile -- just I can't do all of the things. I can really only do one thing at a time, so often I just skipped the eyes thing because it multiplied the amount of effort to understand by 4-8x.
  the thing is, we don't actually communicate well, because for symbolic people, the only concept that they're really putting out is all the *detail* on the picture/symbol they're presenting -- and that just doesn't work for me. I need general, simple, and well understood. I don't care how nice the picture looks; I can't see it.
the other major issue is that nosebook (and other of the vaccine networks) is going to be a major concern if we're doing anything genetically. I'm not trying to destroy anything they create, but I do kinda want to rebuild the X chromosome, so -- like there aren't any more secrets anymore -- because we're doing the same thing, essentially. how in the world can we speak clearly?
  the funny thing about this, is that when I'm stoned and everything is right there in front of me, everything looks like it's happening now (this is source's perspective, cause time is not a separation anymore -- I'm tuning into the latest/fastest frequency version of the concept, so I don't see it through the distortion of time (like water bends light)) --- right?
  then when I return back to the normal 3d world the next day, I realise that nobody can possibly understand the concept as it is *in the present* -- cause that concept translates poorly into symbol. it requires *a lot* of symbols, moving around and doing a lot of actions. I don't have that kind of action potential, but I still see it as now because I can't *see* symbols (and neither can you). (they're sub-atomic, so not visible -- and, anything visible is just a human's best conceptual interpretation of that symbol)
finally, I *like* where I'm at.
at the moment, all things seem to be getting easier and easier (even if I wake up with new challenges each day, by the end of the day, all of those things have improved various times or continuously -- so still easier).
  one of the things that I have sorta come to expect, is that all new things will be something that's generally pretty easy, so from my perspective, all new manifestations (existing ones don't count) are just waiting for the time when those things feel easier to me, and not like a bunch of struggle and effort.
    for example: all things that I'm currently am wanting to program are born out of a desire to use my computer more easily -- because they're *sooo* difficulty to use, I can't work on new hardware yet, so my only option is to fix the software (and I mean that in computer programs, but also in the form of conceptual perception, and low resistance so that the concept can be perceived purely and without my resistant taint). all things I want to make/do whatever are built on the desire of making things easier. there are so many things that could just be so much easier to use, but it seems that those difficult to use things, are a reflection of the world's concepts. I know they're really holding me back (both the people and lousy interface to computer), and I get it that they don't want my technology to get out into the world, because it would upgrade/change the established social-conceptual configurations we have around the planet (cultures).
      I understand that's a huge issue for a lot of people -- and I get it that some people don't want to see things the way I see them -- so they'll settle for seeing things the way a girl sees them: naively -- but in reality, they see it much more for what it is (at least I did as a kid and now), but the thing is, they can't really communicate it, so they can't really talk about it. the most they can do is to show an emotion about it,-- and when she's finally able to talk aobwut it, she's lost that perception being plunged into the world of symbol, and those concepts are now overlaid with a *visual* symbol, so she forgets what it was like to "see" everything before she started rationalise symbolically. it comes back again when resistance is lowered enogh to be able to perceive it again. she'll never be able to turn off the picture though (besides getting a portion of the brain removed, I don't know if we a way to turn off the pinecone so the picture isn'tt a distraction anymore (like me: no-pinecone).
      what I'm saying is that I understand that many people would much prefer to see the world the way a girl sees it (cause she's young and so hasn't had much time to push against the social-cultural matrix, so she jives with the established perception pretty well). I don't really care that others would prefer to be locked into a girl's form of perception, than my own -- cause I'm selfish: I like the way I see things, and I'm not willing to change that.
      also, I've got the world pretty figured out so my the-manual (Y) is pretty solid. I see why things happened as a function of attraction pretty well, so all concepts work together pretty well. if my concepts got shuffled around or replaced, because I'm a pretty powerful conceptual emitter, the whole world will be a bit confused (much like I am afterwards), and it *won't be good*.
        on the bright side (cause you gatta see the bright side), people *conceptually* similar to her will get a sort of upgrade, as I reconfigure all the new/unrecognised concepts and fit the back into the-manual (Y) -- which is basically (pure desire/attraction) -- so everything looks pretty "that's about right" "makes sense" "huh, I totally felt that comin'" -- that sort of thing
        on the darker side, I think it'll cause *a lot* of symbolic disturbance for others that are conceptually similar to her, but use symbol to communicate, because wrong/unexpected/redefined stuff will start to come out. (communication breakdown, which usually affects relationships)

### 2023-07-02 16:05 - the consequence of my intrduction of new technology

one peculiar thing that I noticed today was -- I had an issue in coi that I couldn't resolve easily, and so I needed to reorder m/ technology branch in coi.
  this prompted me to write out a feature report in the form of a mod, whereby the m6d author can simply implement the feature in the mod, and then I'm sure if the feature is pretty awesome, itt could become a part of coi.
    the realisation here is that these failures are of the mental kind -- cause I noticed when I'm playing the game not-stoned, I don't often make those kinds of mistakes often because I see a strategy to what I'm building: like, there's an objective to what I'm doing, and so I'm intuitive enough to get those senses.
      my logical side of the brain is *translating* emotions into logical thoughts, not the otherway around; most people I notice feel an emotion in response to their logic, which is completely normal, because I do too -- but when I'm playing the game sohber, I just completely intuit the thought because whatever I'm often feeling is pretty effortless/optimistic ("I'll figure it out, but this is what I want"), which is very different to how I'm when I'm stoned.
        when I'm stoned, I just *"see"* everything; how it works. like, everything is aparent to me, which is not at all helpful for building a factory, cause I'm seeing the code/concept of the game, not the game itself. I have a hard time relating one thing to another. like, I can kinda see what I want to do, but it's really difficult (you know, it just occurs to me that when I'm stoned, I'm in the "insect" mindset, more than my rational (built) logical/LOA sohber perspective).
      so what you're really seeing is that there I perceive from my (symbolic) Y-perspective, which is very accurate because it's based on LOA (so everything seems completely expectable). in this perspective, I can see the concept, very deeply -- so I can "see" the conceptual machinery that essentially makes our reality work based on LOA; it's a reflection of us (usually), but there are many occupants tthere already, as I think this is like where vulvan sees things.

so here's the thing: when I watch JD play (in the streams), because there are no cuts, it's obvious to me a lot of times when present-JD is causing future-JD mistakes (he points out his own in the editing process -- self editing). I get that, right so it's all good...
  but here's the thing: *all of our concepts are producing that place where vulvan lives*, **and it directly affects all of us**, so we're basically like conceptually invading into this conceptual turf, because I don't really belong here, know what I mean... like there are a lot of archons in my space right, and they're sorta stuck with me, but I'm so attractive it's bound to happen that some of my ideas are going to start getting out, and it'll dramatically improve tthe technology spectrum completely; like we're going to look through a technological lens that is reflective of my state of resistance, but not necessarily the same as "the people" (*the common people*), which is generally of a lot less resistance, so I tend to reflect everyone else.
    think aboout it: reflection is full absorption, **and** full emission, meaning it's bsically *zero resistance*; the lower the resistance, the better of a reflection that it is.
  i'm essentially, a super duper reflector because I'm low resistance. however, *I*'m a powerful emitter of ideas and all the awesome stuff that I see around; my ideas are free, and I just love progress, so we sorta love each other.
however, when I enter new ideas into technology that "restrict" LOA's abolity to punish theirselves for lousy attraction and shitty conceptualisation of reality. I'm the demiurge because I allow others to bypass the effects of LOA and to use technology to fix their lousy attraction (attraction of *unwanted*).

therefore, because we don't want to crash andr burn because we attracted unwanted when the tech was no longer capable of keeping all of their mutual-attraction from producing another badd-feeling reality, along with a few other desires of my own, I basically allow a society to achive a technical accomplishment that is of a qfality/reflection of a much lower resistance (and in some cases, negative), where I emit a considerable amount because I really find myself attracted to it (which is a problem)
  I think this actually goes hand in hand, because what ends up happening is attraction starts to get really strong for a lot of others, because the *technology not their mentality* has made them more attractive, then I find myself in a world of very strange (and very directed attraction); like, you all are so easily influenced, that you're capable of almost everything -- and the last thing that anyone wants is to have attraction toward unwanted (which is what most people are doing).
    to mitigate the effects of my ideas, is to mostly keep them to myself. I interact with the world in a very robotic way, simply because it's the easiest. I don't really want them to have technology that is beyond their resistance, because they'll eventally cause a crash. if we can do this without any massive attraction of unwanted, then it's the best. like, I just want people to learn for theirselves mostly. I'm far too opinionated myself of how things are. I get this reflected in teh form of mr-motor (and all his sidekicks) because they reflect my own opinions back to me in a strange and twisted kind of way -- which is good because I keep learning how to become lower and lower resistance.
      the lower resistance Iecome, the more attractive Iecome, done.
      the thing is then, who and what do I want to reflect? I like reflecting everyone from my own perspective right now, which is essentially why reality-kenny exists. I'm just a robotic dude that just does stuff. like I can just have him do tasks, and he just does them.
        I don't always feel that way, especially in the morning, because I'm| tuned away from that. it takes me a moment, often times I allow myself some time to get through a lot of resistant thought, before I put on the reality-kenny costume. like I'm most resistant in the morning.
          I'm reminded of raquel saying that she didn't want to have sex in the morning because she didn't feel good in the morning. I couldn't understand this at all because back then (this was a different nosebook back then), I felt *great* in the morning; nowadays, not so much.   I tend to want to get going to a good feeling mindset by myself when I wake up, and that's actually pretty different with other people around.
          like, I tend to think about things from a diffreent perspective (from those that I'm around).
    therefore, I'm kind of  chamaleon(?) to the concepts I'm around. when I'm by myself, I really flourish because I get to be really low resistance, and when I'm around others, I tend to reflect their attraction back to them, and for the stuff I'm not fully zero resistance on, I even take it on (absorb) it myself (a dimm reflection; a reflection dimly). I really like being me, so I don't really want to feel good. I should say that better: I don't really want to feel *too* good, because then everything changes, and everyone is forced into a new reality of my own technical machinations, gone aw(r)ay because I've giving a shortcut to a bunch of attractors of unwanted, to not change their attraction, but **get away with it**, with the implements of the technology (they appear lower resistance than they are). welcome to the future.

the thing that really *concerns* me is that, sure they're getting an easy ride, who cares,-- and the answer is that **they care**; that's why they're not getting an easy ride: it's cause they care that someone else is getting something that would also want. they block their own desire with their own anti-desire for everyone else. it's just a cause of negative desire (fear). they want to think that it's anything to do with someone else, but I assure you, it's that they're all reflecting each other dimly; everyone is upset at everyone else's *wantted* manifestations, meaning that they all just hold each other away from their own manifestations by caring what other people are doing.
  I noticed this today when I was interacting with remi, luis, and norma; they had different scripted-expecctations of what I should do when confronted with certain situations. who writes the script? society, mate, family, friends, school, important other, etc.-- and all of those things determine (also nosebook, internet FOX news, 24/7 trolling, memes, influencers) how we're supposed to interact by scripting our expectations.
  think about it: every sitcom to computer interactive media have in these sort of action-plans of how different people should respond to things, be polite, be fair, be vertuous, etc.-- and we folllow the script because we identify with those different characters. that's **syntax** for the society conceptual program. the program we have written/scripted by ourself (with their snytax) is the way that we attract, and everyone has one.
    you could say that all of my interactions are "*not* scripted* but programmed c6nceptually, whichs just a system of feeling the way I want to feel, and then the game just sorta plays itself, or the dishes get done; or whaever. it's just something that I *allow* to happen, and it happens.
    because I'm a nearly perfect (getting closer and closer all the time), this is the best option for me to do because I know that all things that I'm a reflection of, are not really my fault. I really do feel bad sometimes at how otherss clobber theirselves with their own attraction, because I don't really care right. I'm just like "oh, *that* happened; well, it's obviously attracted because **it happened**, so then I assume the worst and find a way to feel good about it.
  so when allie was leaving, there were like these scripted-expectations that I was feeling, and you see the thing is, *I really don't care*, but it feels like I'm supposed to care, so I just avoid the idea completely, because I don't want to get stuck into attraction of their unwanted scripted-expectations, so I just pass on everything. obviously; I **always* assume the worst*, and then just find a way to feel good about it.
    it could be saying that I am, in a sense, **avoiding** the subject by always running away from it, because I sorta am. like, I don't care what anyone else does, so those kinds of thoughts (which get translated from others' scripted-expectations) *because* I'm a dim reflector still, and I have to find a way to feel good about anyone doing any other thing. I really have no dependencies on other people, and they're able to do whatever they want.
so what ends up happening ,now that I notice it, is that's a bit of a shortcut, because I I did still absorb the thought more than reflecting it, meaning for me I still do have resistance on a lot of things. like, I'm *really, *not ready**, so I default to: "I just like being me." don't try to make me otherwise :)% I'll get there when I'm ready.
