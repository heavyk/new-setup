# in-27-days

some comments and thooughts that came about from listening yesterday (2023-05-22) to the concept of in-27-days; worst of all, I took her to mean (because she kept presenting the idea as if it is *not-fiction* -- or, real; like a real-life story) that the person she was talking about in her story, because she would say things like, "you'd be surprised what comes out/pops up" (and other expressions similar -- the experiences that she has in her own narratives resonate (in some way) to the inner part of her mind -- a sort of inner narrative of who she is (written, of course by her in relation to all the stuff she's reacting to)) and so I thought *she* is the main character of her story, so I kept trying to ask her all the things she was saying the "character" is doing.
  shakeshere does this brilliantly, because he exports the mind of the person out into the characters that you/I resonate with -- and so, when we *relate* to them mentally, it causes an emotional reaction within, as if I were the character in the play.
  therefore, you experience yourself by watching his plays; each person resonates with each character differently -- and for me, every single character, I have coplaints with; and the others are uninteresting to me -- like not worth my time (this is btw how narrative ages).
therefore, I kept trying to figure out what in the world happens in her story with all of these characters that she's got going on, have to do with her. I feel like she didn't want to reveal much of the story because nearly instantly I would "get" her and fit her into a box
  it's a bad habit of mine because I have this insatiable desire (like a machine) to figure out everything that I find interesting. some things, for example are very interesting to me, but are also impractical for me to yearn/learn about them, soo I just let my desire to understand those things, simply bring events into my surroundings that explain the idea to me. my entire world is conscious to some degree or another, so I forfeit narration (which usually omits the discovery process), to simply *attracting* them to me. anything I want to know or to figure out, I feel is probably less than a year out -- r(not if you cconsidder that I'm a machine-like in nature) will eventually reduce that time so low (for each now discovery), thatt it''s all *now*.
  sorry for being the demiurge.
    I actually think there's like this giant conspiracy (now because I've figured out so much of reality) thatt watever the AI does not kill, actually takes over your brain in a "brain injury", and it's people like me.
    here's the deal: one thing I've noticed about all brain-injury "victims", is that the're all behaving like completely reacthionary machines -- unconscious (for the most part) that they're reacting to **EVERYTHING** and then trying to use willpower to stay away from some reactions -- when it's far easier to just change the reaction program, and produce a different reaction; that's what I did; and along the way I just got better at reacting to everything. I'm still 100% me (that I was before the "injuries") -- just with an increasing output of machinery in my system. there are a number of different sources for it, but the majority writer of my reactions, is me (which is why I see from the universal perspecttive so easily).
    so then what happens is that when life gets really tough and brain starts emitting enough pain because of the things I think about, and it continues to rise until my good-feeling receptors/reactions emits eventually enough of a painful vibration into the surrounding, that it causes the haemorrhage (to turn off the spot), or causes the event which will turn off that part of the brain (so one can be free from suffering) -- and I think it has to do with real true depression, when you feel *done*; well-done, mom sayss. -- cause for me there have been enough times when I just finally kinda "give up" and just be done: *I don't understand*! and then just let it be something different than I imagine/planned it to be (ie, the narrative).
    after that, I simply find a way to no longer need tto narrate how something should be, and instead just allow itt to be whatever it wants to be (a reflection of my perception)... that puts me into attraction mode, because I'm looking at things from a purely efficiency state of mind.
      it's funny; you're never going to believe this; but, the most efficient state of mind, is like a child's; the apponents simply can't keep up, because their efficiency is wayyy/so much lower, you know.
now, for an example:

so I was thinking about the idea of what is (actually) 27 days from now; well, it's 6-18 -- a little bit earlier in/than june, than "a midsommers' night dream" a play whos manifestation was so appalling (in comparison to what is happening now), that the narration angle is starting to feel "not good enough" -- like why bother? itt seems like so much work, and is cumbersome and ineffective; etc., blah blah blah.
  once we're detaching from narrative, I can now narrate in a negative sense: it is a bad idea to narrate. so I'll go ahead and tell you instead, (through example) of why narrative is bad.
so now, imagine the dedication of this log, is to figure out what in-27-days *could* mean; and there will be some different narrative persectives that will put us in different zones and things -- but this is all about building the demiurge that we want, by forcing an evolution-of-desire.

first thing I would want (brb)
