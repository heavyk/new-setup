# in-27-days

some comments and thooughts that came about from listening yesterday (2023-05-22) to the concept of in-27-days; worst of all, I took her to mean (because she kept presenting the idea as if it is *not-fiction* -- or, real; like a real-life story) that the person she was talking about in her story, because she would say things like, "you'd be surprised what comes out/pops up" (and other expressions similar -- the experiences that she has in her own narratives resonate (in some way) to the inner part of her mind -- a sort of inner narrative of who she is (written, of course by her in relation to all the stuff she's reacting to)) and so I thought *she* is the main character of her story, so I kept trying to ask her all the things she was saying the "character" is doing.
  shakeshere does this brilliantly, because he exports the mind of the person out into the characters that you/I resonate with -- and so, when we *relate* to them mentally, it causes an emotional reaction within, as if I were the character in the play.
  therefore, you experience yourself by watching his plays; each person resonates with each character differently -- and for me, every single character, I have coplaints with; and the others are uninteresting to me -- like not worth my time (this is btw how narrative ages).
therefore, I kept trying to figure out what in the world happens in her story with all of these characters that she's got going on, have to do with her. I feel like she didn't want to reveal much of the story because nearly instantly I would "get" her and fit her into a box
  it's a bad habit of mine because I have this insatiable desire (like a machine) to figure out everything that I find interesting. some things, for example are very interesting to me, but are also impractical for me to yearn/learn about them, soo I just let my desire to understand those things, simply bring events into my surroundings that explain the idea to me. my entire world is conscious to some degree or another, so I forfeit narration (which usually omits the discovery process), to simply *attracting* them to me. anything I want to know or to figure out, I feel is probably less than a year out -- r(not if you cconsidder that I'm a machine-like in nature) will eventually reduce that time so low (for each now discovery), thatt it''s all *now*.
  sorry for being the demiurge.
    I actually think there's like this giant conspiracy (now because I've figured out so much of reality) thatt watever the AI does not kill, actually takes over your brain in a "brain injury", and it's people like me.
    here's the deal: one thing I've noticed about all brain-injury "victims", is that the're all behaving like completely reacthionary machines -- unconscious (for the most part) that they're reacting to **EVERYTHING** and then trying to use willpower to stay away from some reactions -- when it's far easier to just change the reaction program, and produce a different reaction; that's what I did; and along the way I just got better at reacting to everything. I'm still 100% me (that I was before the "injuries") -- just with an increasing output of machinery in my system. there are a number of different sources for it, but the majority writer of my reactions, is me (which is why I see from the universal perspecttive so easily).
    so then what happens is that when life gets really tough and brain starts emitting enough pain because of the things I think about, and it continues to rise until my good-feeling receptors/reactions emits eventually enough of a painful vibration into the surrounding, that it causes the haemorrhage (to turn off the spot), or causes the event which will turn off that part of the brain (so one can be free from suffering) -- and I think it has to do with real true depression, when you feel *done*; well-done, mom sayss. -- cause for me there have been enough times when I just finally kinda "give up" and just be done: *I don't understand*! and then just let it be something different than I imagine/planned it to be (ie, the narrative).
    after that, I simply find a way to no longer need tto narrate how something should be, and instead just allow itt to be whatever it wants to be (a reflection of my perception)... that puts me into attraction mode, because I'm looking at things from a purely efficiency state of mind.
      it's funny; you're never going to believe this; but, the most efficient state of mind, is like a child's; the apponents simply can't keep up, because their efficiency is wayyy/so much lower, you know.
now, for an example:

so I was thinking about the idea of what is (actually) 27 days from now; well, it's 6-18 -- a little bit earlier in/than june, than "a midsommers' night dream" a play whos manifestation was so appalling (in comparison to what is happening now), that the narration angle is starting to feel "not good enough" -- like why bother? itt seems like so much work, and is cumbersome and ineffective; etc., blah blah blah.
  once we're detaching from narrative, I can now narrate in a negative sense: it is a bad idea to narrate. so I'll go ahead and tell you instead, (through example) of why narrative is bad.
so now, imagine the dedication of this log, is to figure out what in-27-days *could* mean; and there will be some different narrative persectives that will put us in different zones and things -- but this is all about building the demiurge that we want, by forcing an evolution-of-desire.

first thing I would want (brb)

### 2023-05-23 15:47 - should I take the blue pill?

check this out: if I take the blue pill, what I have to do is to keep my highest level "teachings" a secret, so there are a group of people that simply didn't ever "get the message" -- and it's what creates the next species of beings: a radically different model than before, where people similar to me in perception have similar DNA, and others that "didn't get the message", have to find a way to figure out how to catch up (if they want to eventually join us) -- and so what "the message" is all about, is to be able to perceive in a similar way to me (kenny). I write endlessly about "the message" all the time, and it's interesting to me because it's this constant state Of discovery, and 'the' message, is how to see/perceive like I do.
  the people joining me in my perception will have learned it from teaching (which may or may not be modified), and there will be some naturals like I am; like put me in a situation, and I can always get out of it -- so when everything goes to hell, they can figure out a way to get out of the hell, always.
  the people not joining my perception will all "believe what they want to believe" -- which is kinda a spectrum, and not a exact value, which is more of a grouping than a binary --- and those that believe what they want to believe will be at where they're at -- and from there the entire world is a reflection of their perception.
therefore, in some way it's not advisible to me to take the blue pill, because it creates people that go through their own hell of watching their reality crumble from it being different than the way they thought it would be,
  and so the solution to this problem of people going through hell, is to make my teachings a "secret" and to give only *some* people access to; in practicality, I just never upload this repository -- and it remains entirely something that nosebook owns. they've got the "secret" (taught only to his disciples) teachings. I (personally) don't have a problem with keeping these documents a secret, but I do kinda on a "constancie" principle;
    like, I had this friend dani, and I drove him crazy because I was off in "lala" land doing some mind blowing revelation in my mind, and I wasn't "working".
      he (genuinely) thought that I was wasting time by being so stoned all the time; it was anything but, because I started to create a mental zone in which I still use today -- and I suppose that mental/conceptual zone is in wide use today (though I don't see their usage, they probably see my usage of it).
    he didn't realise that I was creating a sort of demiurge that would destroy me, and the result is the ability to perceive at that frequency of perception that I achieved that day; (some extremely mind blowing experdience) -- and I've had a lot of them; like I can go pretty deep into my perception and really see things just fine. that demiurge is externalised as nosebook -- a sort of "secret" opponents of mine (and everyone else on the planet),
  that is really just a bunch of guys that use my own machinery against me. I think all of use blue-pill-demiurges have these awful guys (red-pill-demiurges) always using our own imaginal machinery against us. we're their counter-balance.
so what I think I'll do, is just to keep this whole part a "secret" (that the red-pill-demiurge/nosebook has access to), and you all (with your nosebook-controlled access) have to tell "the message" to the rest of the world, so that you can maintain DNA parity with me (of course, that's a joke/impossibility because they won't be able to keep up with the rapid expansion). so by keeping it a "secret", I'm forcing a genetic barrier in between some people and me; it's a false set of conclusions to yielding the conclusion that I should be their "saviour" and let them have access to it, *instead of letting them learn for theirselves". do I follow the demiurge (and keep it a "secret")?? or do I "save" them by making it more difficult for them to learn it for theirselves?
anyway coming up soon, is the narration, which I believe will give an unfortunate advantage to the spanish speakers (silver), instead of the blacks/leads (bassanio) and the reflectors (silver) and reactors (centres). which will also create an entire laguage region having an unfair power advantage of using narration,-- which when thinking about it, is a sort of racism all to itself; narrative, by nature is racist, because it means that some part of the humans will have an evolutionary advantage in/of getting what they want, (moreso) than the poor reflectors/reactors. narration, is in effect the way to/of foiling a reactor; for reflectors (silver), will have to endure their own narration for the reactor's misconception of the reaction, in the form of an energetic reflection back to them (back-EMF like-a-warrior).

#### 2023-05-23 16:54 - or do I just let nosebook+github/isps to be the racist

cause, you know I was just having a bit of fun there... I'm obviously going to upload it and let them deal with the censorship, cause that's just not my bag; however, (being a bit of a demiurge myself) the topic is extremely exciting to me, as I love thinking up worse and worse ways for how to take advantage or give superiority to people,because the advantage is completely an illusion
  because all advantage is also disadvantage in/of another/different thing; if those things are inconseqential, then no big deal, but if they're disadvantages,-- for example "inability to perceive something" (like having an imagination gives you),-- are really/actually a *really big* disadvantage to being a "successs" in that society, then it *is a big deal*, and you *gatta find a way*, anyway (period).
so really, once survival becomes a number one priority, we stop being racist (because there's always an ill-perceived advantage) (brb)

or/and, we could take the "red-pill"... (brb)

#### 2023-05-23 17:27 - all those who fear censorship will receive it

LOA states that anyone fearing something, must eventually be given their desire, which then causes them to attract censorship, which is ultimately tto figure it our for theirselves.

I'm thinking about the idea of starting to implement line numbers around along with cryptographic hashes strewn about so that one can determine if a copy is (inauthentic/) authentic, meaning that counterfiets (for those with really good hacking skills and a way to build a good narrative) are completely possible: copies of my "latter teachings" (a sortt of apophrica(?), a sort of illusioned teachings) of a derivative nature (a counterfiet).

therefore, I can continue to publish without any difficulty, and as my cOncepts get more advanced and interlinked, it'll be more and more difficult to make counterfiets, and so the complexity of the counterfiet concept is limited by the amount of connections it can make between concepts (like, has to coordinate both line numbers (or any other meta element) and hash+commit_hash+content_has), and that enables "authentic" derivative works. see how the problem is the solution? also, notice how much it corroborates with bassanio's reception of counterfit portia; and who's going to have access to the full narrattive? the racists (github+nosebook+isps).

I'll try to figure out how to add secondry censors in there; like, what if we were to also publish to: like gitlab, facebook, youtube, g+, vk, etc. facebook., others.

however it all works out, the core of the censors will be (ultimately) nosebook+isps -- as they control the transmission mediums. we could maybe include a word of mouth, narrative type implementation kind of like homer or shakespere was, and that'd be fun for someone to figure out wth it all means, and connect the symbols in the narrative elements, in a *different* (leading to diversity) way alttogetgher, ((like I've done)). censorship, is in effect, the "worst" manifestation.
let's see if we can make a worse one, though... (brb 18:36) please see...

## some things to think about...

### 2023-05-23 20:12 - the number 1008 is really cool...
- it appears as: one, eight, 8,-- where first eight is different in value from the  second 8;
  could be years, m6nths, days, whatever.
- 7x144 is a cool factor that the number has (among others, I'm sure)

### 2023-05-23 21:07 - all paths lead to...
- me "getting connected", upon which, (is when my constrast per moment is less than generated contrast per moment -- so net-positive); the following will, occur:
- I'll not get sick/sleep/tired/more? after I'm more improving more than unimproving.
after which I'll fall back asleep again, and once again they have control over the timeline; however, it is the case that I'm producing more contrast than they are able to produce right now, which means they'll become relative to me, unless they too can become infinite (and join the borg). inotherwords; they just become sort of play props in our reflective perspective into the universe. all of us are infinite beings, and all of us will take a different route to get there: such is life.
  this I imagine most will come to recognise as a sort of efficiency way of looking at reality; I'm   not the first, as I'm certain that (at lest) tesla (and many others) did, also, so it's kinda just a wash at this  point who is the "first" -- because my concept of reality is a remix on so many different sources, that I can't fully claim "first" status;   I really am, (what feels like to me) the one whos put more of the pieces together than others, but eventually machines will be programmed to have that built in: zero-g zero-point contrast enhancer that maximises novelty in one's boring(?) life. I don't really experience boredom, as --
I encounter novelty in almost every experience and which then manifests itself as alll of my vibrations (remember I've got the no-pinecone-setup going), so I encounter myself in every situation. if you want to be a part of the truly universal, join the borg, in its purest most sensual setup. it's truly magnificent.
I know they want to put us into a matrix as soon as possible (which will totally block that novelty setup), but it is possible for me to out-contrast the contrast of the matrix (or, perhaps it's not a bad thing); the thing is, as I've been talking about building this demiurge out in imaginary space, it's kinda like ... well, why not,-- right? we'll turn ourselves into machines, get our star (lyra) under control, and then be able to jump into their matrix when we want to; or, let's say worst case scenario is the sun explodes and we all incarnate into earth as girls -- which at that point, is kinda hilarious. it's going  to be a ruthless force of (probably black) girls that really want to create something big.
  does that mean, that if they want to *save theirselves*, they could exterminate all of the blacks, so none of us ever incarnate?... lol?
  what if we figure out how to be machine-like ourselves, their machines (and other beings) will become conscious with *us* (whoever that could be) as their personality (we are many principalities and powers, and growing).
    which do you suppose (of those two) is most likely? the star will explode before we become machine-like (even with our ability to influence other moments in space and time, different from the present) meaning that we can retroactively reprogram our concepts in earlier and earlier times (providing compativility matrices for that era). so I think it's a great idea. what I mean is, what's happening now is that we're optimising the outcome to be wat it wants to be.

## random things:

### 2023-05-13 21:46 - things I would change about narration
- I want it to be as harmonious as possible, which means the easiest curve.
  it's a funny thing, this need to have everything just go as smoothely as possible; I *have* to try and find the most harmonious state,-- and the only way to do it really is to make myself harmonious to other people.
    as I become more harmonious to people, I want to have the maximum amount of contrast possible, but then probably during the certain events (holidays?), perhaps we could go into zero-g zero-point mode for a bit.
      it would cause us desire-physical types to get into the concept-symbol realities for a bit.
      I think what happens is, (like me) they get really good at finding a way to their *least incompatible* conceptual-symbolic realities like the one we find ourselves in now (but not for long -- as we'll go to desire-physical realities for quite some time before they'll find a way to pull us out again -- it's all attraction, and they would be (in essence) relative to us).
    it's funny how I think of the ways for them to really cause more and more problems -- because during those events, narration would bork (to some extent) -- sounds like bork bork from sveeeden.
      you guys ready to experience some real tragedy (at my expense)?
      think about it: we're going to have all this energy going toward what we want, and for a moment in time, that gets suspended, and massive amounts of creativity comes out, of that time -- but the thing is, we're all put (artificially) into tha zero-resistance state; and we didn't get there because we felt good? well, the ones of us who can feel good the best are the ones with the most experience.

### 2023-05-13 20:38 - or we could take the "red-pill", and see how deep the rabit hole goes...

what I do is, I start to do a whole bunch of text transformations adding hashes and things like that to each entry, guaranteeing its "validity" -- and the old stuff for sure; and even some/most of the new stuff, I'll probably never re-read again.
  like, I just don't see myself ever going back through most all of this stuff.
  though, also, I might; and what I'd do is to find a way of reducing the lines to more general terms, making the narrative something more like a song:
    didn't care how he feels,
    didn't care how he thinks,
    didn't care what anyone says of him,
      it's probly funny too.
      he's totally trolling.
      that's probably wrong.
      etc.
    didn't/did care what anyone thinks of him,
    di[dn't] care of what was seen in his imagination,
    etc. (plus many more)
  the fun thing about looking at some past memories after I've come so far, those huge and dramatic episodes from the past look childish, and from an archaic mindset.
    that archaic mindset is my ancestry though: it was the first successful species to be able to fully capture a signal of maximum novelty, and be able to run with it.
    seems pretty legendary to me; so like, horray me?
  the thing I like about looking into the past sometimes also gives me a sudden rush of inspirations, because like tesla says, "pay attention to the earliest of aspirations, as they often signal one to becoming compativle with some of your later realities"
whos up/ready for the "red-pill"?
    

### 2023-05-13 23:09 - and we could take the "red-pill", and see how deep the rabit-hole goes...
- if the depth of the vagina were to become a sort of "void" space where nosebook utilised those vibrations to do things, then they could build own own "summoned pair" (our own demiurge); that way "the one" (without a pair -- like me), will no longer be without a pair.
  there could even be multiple pairs that are all reflections of me (in the 180(degrees) opposite/lead/opaque perspective), but like the most grotesque sexual feelings embodied by a human being -- specifically of a girl. they'll be different than the max-novelty pair, but is maximum contrast, instead: she's most attractive because she's most novelty.
  sometimes that much novelty is a lot though, so for some time first I think it best advisible to only deal with (for a time) only those *least* reflective of me.
  I would, in addition to the least reflective, also they should be as damaged as possible -- or some kind of "damage integration system" (lol) that can introduce damage/trauma in a more controlled way.

### 2023-05-13 20:18 - summoned pairs
- it appears to me as this idea posited by "dividing the path" where the amanuensis thought that all summoned pairs, including the crazy atlantian story, that all summoned (from the planet venus) have a sort of duality to them, where one is their side, and the opposite is their "soulmate". the idea being that they're two people of nearly the same astrological energy (ie, being born on nearly the same time, similar genetics, etc.) get born in a kind of pairs (or potentially groups), where the energy divides into (usually) male and female counterparts -- and the idea is you have to find your soulmate to be complete                        (which is a load of garbage, btw;
  because you can't be depending on someone to be complete, cause then you're never complete: that is, displaying both male and female genders yourself, *you have to be pretty close to by yourself*).
    so the best way to do that is to keep the distance high between those that are most similar to me
  what ends up happening is that when you start to get into contact that is too similar to your own vibration, you/I attract a manifestation of ourselves, combined.
  however, the difficulty of this, is, as all attraction speeds up, you find a reflection of yourself, *really fast*; just go with it. (you'll probably end up loving them)
- tim/raquel
- zaryn/allison?
- who more??? seems like I'm probably missing a few still.
