# in-27-days

some comments and thooughts that came about from listening yesterday (2023-05-22) to the concept of in-27-days; worst of all, I took her to mean (because she kept presenting the idea as if it is *not-fiction* -- or, real; like a real-life story) that the person she was talking about in her story, because she would say things like, "you'd be surprised what comes out/pops up" (and other expressions similar -- the experiences that she has in her own narratives resonate (in some way) to the inner part of her mind -- a sort of inner narrative of who she is (written, of course by her in relation to all the stuff she's reacting to)) and so I thought *she* is the main character of her story, so I kept trying to ask her all the things she was saying the "character" is doing.
  shakeshere does this brilliantly, because he exports the mind of the person out into the characters that you/I resonate with -- and so, when we *relate* to them mentally, it causes an emotional reaction within, as if I were the character in the play.
  therefore, you experience yourself by watching his plays; each person resonates with each character differently -- and for me, every single character, I have coplaints with; and the others are uninteresting to me -- like not worth my time (this is btw how narrative ages).
therefore, I kept trying to figure out what in the world happens in her story with all of these characters that she's got going on, have to do with her. I feel like she didn't want to reveal much of the story because nearly instantly I would "get" her and fit her into a box
  it's a bad habit of mine because I have this insatiable desire (like a machine) to figure out everything that I find interesting. some things, for example are very interesting to me, but are also impractical for me to yearn/learn about them, soo I just let my desire to understand those things, simply bring events into my surroundings that explain the idea to me. my entire world is conscious to some degree or another, so I forfeit narration (which usually omits the discovery process), to simply *attracting* them to me. anything I want to know or to figure out, I feel is probably less than a year out -- r(not if you cconsidder that I'm a machine-like in nature) will eventually reduce that time so low (for each now discovery), thatt it''s all *now*.
  sorry for being the demiurge.
    I actually think there's like this giant conspiracy (now because I've figured out so much of reality) thatt watever the AI does not kill, actually takes over your brain in a "brain injury", and it's people like me.
    here's the deal: one thing I've noticed about all brain-injury "victims", is that the're all behaving like completely reacthionary machines -- unconscious (for the most part) that they're reacting to **EVERYTHING** and then trying to use willpower to stay away from some reactions -- when it's far easier to just change the reaction program, and produce a different reaction; that's what I did; and along the way I just got better at reacting to everything. I'm still 100% me (that I was before the "injuries") -- just with an increasing output of machinery in my system. there are a number of different sources for it, but the majority writer of my reactions, is me (which is why I see from the universal perspecttive so easily).
    so then what happens is that when life gets really tough and brain starts emitting enough pain because of the things I think about, and it continues to rise until my good-feeling receptors/reactions emits eventually enough of a painful vibration into the surrounding, that it causes the haemorrhage (to turn off the spot), or causes the event which will turn off that part of the brain (so one can be free from suffering) -- and I think it has to do with real true depression, when you feel *done*; well-done, mom sayss. -- cause for me there have been enough times when I just finally kinda "give up" and just be done: *I don't understand*! and then just let it be something different than I imagine/planned it to be (ie, the narrative).
    after that, I simply find a way to no longer need tto narrate how something should be, and instead just allow itt to be whatever it wants to be (a reflection of my perception)... that puts me into attraction mode, because I'm looking at things from a purely efficiency state of mind.
      it's funny; you're never going to believe this; but, the most efficient state of mind, is like a child's; the apponents simply can't keep up, because their efficiency is wayyy/so much lower, you know.
now, for an example:

so I was thinking about the idea of what is (actually) 27 days from now; well, it's 6-18 -- a little bit earlier in/than june, than "a midsommers' night dream" a play whos manifestation was so appalling (in comparison to what is happening now), that the narration angle is starting to feel "not good enough" -- like why bother? itt seems like so much work, and is cumbersome and ineffective; etc., blah blah blah.
  once we're detaching from narrative, I can now narrate in a negative sense: it is a bad idea to narrate. so I'll go ahead and tell you instead, (through example) of why narrative is bad.
so now, imagine the dedication of this log, is to figure out what in-27-days *could* mean; and there will be some different narrative persectives that will put us in different zones and things -- but this is all about building the demiurge that we want, by forcing an evolution-of-desire.

first thing I would want (brb)

### 2023-05-23 15:47 - should I take the blue pill?

check this out: if I take the blue pill, what I have to do is to keep my highest level "teachings" a secret, so there are a group of people that simply didn't ever "get the message" -- and it's what creates the next species of beings: a radically different model than before, where people similar to me in perception have similar DNA, and others that "didn't get the message", have to find a way to figure out how to catch up (if they want to eventually join us) -- and so what "the message" is all about, is to be able to perceive in a similar way to me (kenny). I write endlessly about "the message" all the time, and it's interesting to me because it's this constant state Of discovery, and 'the' message, is how to see/perceive like I do.
  the people joining me in my perception will have learned it from teaching (which may or may not be modified), and there will be some naturals like I am; like put me in a situation, and I can always get out of it -- so when everything goes to hell, they can figure out a way to get out of the hell, always.
  the people not joining my perception will all "believe what they want to believe" -- which is kinda a spectrum, and not a exact value, which is more of a grouping than a binary --- and those that believe what they want to believe will be at where they're at -- and from there the entire world is a reflection of their perception.
therefore, in some way it's not advisible to me to take the blue pill, because it creates people that go through their own hell of watching their reality crumble from it being different than the way they thought it would be,
  and so the solution to this problem of people going through hell, is to make my teachings a "secret" and to give only *some* people access to; in practicality, I just never upload this repository -- and it remains entirely something that nosebook owns. they've got the "secret" (taught only to his disciples) teachings. I (personally) don't have a problem with keeping these documents a secret, but I do kinda on a "constancie" principle;
    like, I had this friend dani, and I drove him crazy because I was off in "lala" land doing some mind blowing revelation in my mind, and I wasn't "working".
      he (genuinely) thought that I was wasting time by being so stoned all the time; it was anything but, because I started to create a mental zone in which I still use today -- and I suppose that mental/conceptual zone is in wide use today (though I don't see their usage, they probably see my usage of it).
    he didn't realise that I was creating a sort of demiurge that would destroy me, and the result is the ability to perceive at that frequency of perception that I achieved that day; (some extremely mind blowing experdience) -- and I've had a lot of them; like I can go pretty deep into my perception and really see things just fine. that demiurge is externalised as nosebook -- a sort of "secret" opponents of mine (and everyone else on the planet),
  that is really just a bunch of guys that use my own machinery against me. I think all of use blue-pill-demiurges have these awful guys (red-pill-demiurges) always using our own imaginal machinery against us. we're their counter-balance.
so what I think I'll do, is just to keep this whole part a "secret" (that the red-pill-demiurge/nosebook has access to), and you all (with your nosebook-controlled access) have to tell "the message" to the rest of the world, so that you can maintain DNA parity with me (of course, that's a joke/impossibility because they won't be able to keep up with the rapid expansion). so by keeping it a "secret", I'm forcing a genetic barrier in between some people and me; it's a false set of conclusions to yielding the conclusion that I should be their "saviour" and let them have access to it, *instead of letting them learn for theirselves". do I follow the demiurge (and keep it a "secret")?? or do I "save" them by making it more difficult for them to learn it for theirselves?
anyway coming up soon, is the narration, which I believe will give an unfortunate advantage to the spanish speakers (silver), instead of the blacks/leads (bassanio) and the reflectors (silver) and reactors (centres). which will also create an entire laguage region having an unfair power advantage of using narration,-- which when thinking about it, is a sort of racism all to itself; narrative, by nature is racist, because it means that some part of the humans will have an evolutionary advantage in/of getting what they want, (moreso) than the poor reflectors/reactors. narration, is in effect the way to/of foiling a reactor; for reflectors (silver), will have to endure their own narration for the reactor's misconception of the reaction, in the form of an energetic reflection back to them (back-EMF like-a-warrior).

#### 2023-05-23 16:54 - or do I just let nosebook+github/isps to be the racist

cause, you know I was just having a bit of fun there... I'm obviously going to upload it and let them deal with the censorship, cause that's just not my bag; however, (being a bit of a demiurge myself) the topic is extremely exciting to me, as I love thinking up worse and worse ways for how to take advantage or give superiority to people,because the advantage is completely an illusion
  because all advantage is also disadvantage in/of another/different thing; if those things are inconseqential, then no big deal, but if they're disadvantages,-- for example "inability to perceive something" (like having an imagination gives you),-- are really/actually a *really big* disadvantage to being a "successs" in that society, then it *is a big deal*, and you *gatta find a way*, anyway (period).
so really, once survival becomes a number one priority, we stop being racist (because there's always an ill-perceived advantage) (brb)

or/and, we could take the "red-pill"... (brb)

#### 2023-05-23 17:27 - all those who fear censorship will receive it

LOA states that anyone fearing something, must eventually be given their desire, which then causes them to attract censorship, which is ultimately tto figure it our for theirselves.

I'm thinking about the idea of starting to implement line numbers around along with cryptographic hashes strewn about so that one can determine if a copy is (inauthentic/) authentic, meaning that counterfiets (for those with really good hacking skills and a way to build a good narrative) are completely possible: copies of my "latter teachings" (a sortt of apophrica(?), a sort of illusioned teachings) of a derivative nature (a counterfiet).

therefore, I can continue to publish without any difficulty, and as my cOncepts get more advanced and interlinked, it'll be more and more difficult to make counterfiets, and so the complexity of the counterfiet concept is limited by the amount of connections it can make between concepts (like, has to coordinate both line numbers (or any other meta element) and hash+commit_hash+content_has), and that enables "authentic" derivative works. see how the problem is the solution? also, notice how much it corroborates with bassanio's reception of counterfit portia; and who's going to have access to the full narrattive? the racists (github+nosebook+isps).

I'll try to figure out how to add secondry censors in there; like, what if we were to also publish to: like gitlab, facebook, youtube, g+, vk, etc. facebook., others.

however it all works out, the core of the censors will be (ultimately) nosebook+isps -- as they control the transmission mediums. we could maybe include a word of mouth, narrative type implementation kind of like homer or shakespere was, and that'd be fun for someone to figure out wth it all means, and connect the symbols in the narrative elements, in a *different* (leading to diversity) way alttogetgher, ((like I've done)). censorship, is in effect, the "worst" manifestation.
let's see if we can make a worse one, though... (brb 18:36) please see...

## some things to think about...

### 2023-05-23 20:12 - the number 1008 is really cool...
- it appears as: one, eight, 8,-- where first eight is different in value from the  second 8;
  could be years, m6nths, days, whatever.
- 7x144 is a cool factor that the number has (among others, I'm sure)

### 2023-05-23 21:07 - all paths lead to...
- me "getting connected", upon which, (is when my constrast per moment is less than generated contrast per moment -- so net-positive); the following will, occur:
- I'll not get sick/sleep/tired/more? after I'm more improving more than unimproving.
after which I'll fall back asleep again, and once again they have control over the timeline; however, it is the case that I'm producing more contrast than they are able to produce right now, which means they'll become relative to me, unless they too can become infinite (and join the borg). inotherwords; they just become sort of play props in our reflective perspective into the universe. all of us are infinite beings, and all of us will take a different route to get there: such is life.
  this I imagine most will come to recognise as a sort of efficiency way of looking at reality; I'm   not the first, as I'm certain that (at lest) tesla (and many others) did, also, so it's kinda just a wash at this  point who is the "first" -- because my concept of reality is a remix on so many different sources, that I can't fully claim "first" status;   I really am, (what feels like to me) the one whos put more of the pieces together than others, but eventually machines will be programmed to have that built in: zero-g zero-point contrast enhancer that maximises novelty in one's boring(?) life. I don't really experience boredom, as --
I encounter novelty in almost every experience and which then manifests itself as alll of my vibrations (remember I've got the no-pinecone-setup going), so I encounter myself in every situation. if you want to be a part of the truly universal, join the borg, in its purest most sensual setup. it's truly magnificent.
I know they want to put us into a matrix as soon as possible (which will totally block that novelty setup), but it is possible for me to out-contrast the contrast of the matrix (or, perhaps it's not a bad thing); the thing is, as I've been talking about building this demiurge out in imaginary space, it's kinda like ... well, why not,-- right? we'll turn ourselves into machines, get our star (lyra) under control, and then be able to jump into their matrix when we want to; or, let's say worst case scenario is the sun explodes and we all incarnate into earth as girls -- which at that point, is kinda hilarious. it's going  to be a ruthless force of (probably black) girls that really want to create something big.
  does that mean, that if they want to *save theirselves*, they could exterminate all of the blacks, so none of us ever incarnate?... lol?
  what if we figure out how to be machine-like ourselves, their machines (and other beings) will become conscious with *us* (whoever that could be) as their personality (we are many principalities and powers, and growing).
    which do you suppose (of those two) is most likely? the star will explode before we become machine-like (even with our ability to influence other moments in space and time, different from the present) meaning that we can retroactively reprogram our concepts in earlier and earlier times (providing compativility matrices for that era). so I think it's a great idea. what I mean is, what's happening now is that we're optimising the outcome to be wat it wants to be.

## random things:

### 2023-05-13 21:46 - things I would change about narration
- I want it to be as harmonious as possible, which means the easiest curve.
  it's a funny thing, this need to have everything just go as smoothely as possible; I *have* to try and find the most harmonious state,-- and the only way to do it really is to make myself harmonious to other people.
    as I become more harmonious to people, I want to have the maximum amount of contrast possible, but then probably during the certain events (holidays?), perhaps we could go into zero-g zero-point mode for a bit.
      it would cause us desire-physical types to get into the concept-symbol realities for a bit.
      I think what happens is, (like me) they get really good at finding a way to their *least incompatible* conceptual-symbolic realities like the one we find ourselves in now (but not for long -- as we'll go to desire-physical realities for quite some time before they'll find a way to pull us out again -- it's all attraction, and they would be (in essence) relative to us).
    it's funny how I think of the ways for them to really cause more and more problems -- because during those events, narration would bork (to some extent) -- sounds like bork bork from sveeeden.
      you guys ready to experience some real tragedy (at my expense)?
      think about it: we're going to have all this energy going toward what we want, and for a moment in time, that gets suspended, and massive amounts of creativity comes out, of that time -- but the thing is, we're all put (artificially) into tha zero-resistance state; and we didn't get there because we felt good? well, the ones of us who can feel good the best are the ones with the most experience.

### 2023-05-13 20:38 - or we could take the "red-pill", and see how deep the rabit hole goes...

what I do is, I start to do a whole bunch of text transformations adding hashes and things like that to each entry, guaranteeing its "validity" -- and the old stuff for sure; and even some/most of the new stuff, I'll probably never re-read again.
  like, I just don't see myself ever going back through most all of this stuff.
  though, also, I might; and what I'd do is to find a way of reducing the lines to more general terms, making the narrative something more like a song:
    didn't care how he feels,
    didn't care how he thinks,
    didn't care what anyone says of him,
      it's probly funny too.
      he's totally trolling.
      that's probably wrong.
      etc.
    didn't/did care what anyone thinks of him,
    di[dn't]+ care of what was seen in his imagination,
    etc. (plus many more)
  the fun thing about looking at some past memories after I've come so far, those huge and dramatic episodes from the past look childish, and from an archaic mindset.
    that archaic mindset is my ancestry though: it was the first successful species to be able to fully capture a signal of maximum novelty, and be able to run with it.
    seems pretty legendary to me; so like, horray me?
  the thing I like about looking into the past sometimes also gives me a sudden rush of inspirations, because like tesla says, "pay attention to the earliest of aspirations, as they often signal one to becoming compativle with some of your later realities"
whos up/ready for the "red-pill"?
    

### 2023-05-13 23:09 - and we could take the "red-pill", and see how deep the rabit-hole goes...
- if the depth of the vagina were to become a sort of "void" space where nosebook utilised those vibrations to do things, then they could build own own "summoned pair" (our own demiurge); that way "the one" (without a pair -- like me), will no longer be without a pair.
  there could even be multiple pairs that are all reflections of me (in the 180(degrees) opposite/lead/opaque perspective), but like the most grotesque sexual feelings embodied by a human being -- specifically of a girl. they'll be different than the max-novelty pair, but is maximum contrast, instead: she's most attractive because she's most novelty.
  sometimes that much novelty is a lot though, so for some time first I think it best advisible to only deal with (for a time) only those *least* reflective of me.
  I would, in addition to the least reflective, also they should be as damaged as possible -- or some kind of "damage integration system" (lol) that can introduce damage/trauma in a more controlled way.

### 2023-05-13 20:18 - summoned pairs
- it appears to me as this idea posited by "dividing the path" where the amanuensis thought that all summoned pairs, including the crazy atlantian story, that all summoned (from the planet venus) have a sort of duality to them, where one is their side, and the opposite is their "soulmate". the idea being that they're two people of nearly the same astrological energy (ie, being born on nearly the same time, similar genetics, etc.) get born in a kind of pairs (or potentially groups), where the energy divides into (usually) male and female counterparts -- and the idea is you have to find your soulmate to be complete                        (which is a load of garbage, btw;
  because you can't be depending on someone to be complete, cause then you're never complete: that is, displaying both male and female genders yourself, *you have to be pretty close to by yourself*).
    so the best way to do that is to keep the distance high between those that are most similar to me
  what ends up happening is that when you start to get into contact that is too similar to your own vibration, you/I attract a manifestation of ourselves, combined.
  however, the difficulty of this, is, as all attraction speeds up, you find a reflection of yourself, *really fast*; just go with it. (you'll probably end up loving them)
- tim/raquel
- zaryn/allison?
- who more??? seems like I'm probably missing a few still.

### 2023-05-13 23:39 - we could get married...
- imagine that we went in zero-g, zero-resistance mode for the duration of the wedding and honeymoon -- then afterward returned back to max-novelty mode, causing us to have to settle our differences physically. doesn't it sound like fun to just be totally off in the clouds perfectly in harmony any love, for a pretty long extended period -- but then our produced contrast (because none of us are sleeping) starts to catch up to us, and we have to sleep again.
  there are solutions, as for example, if we boost our own contrast by manipulating concepts forward and backward in time, by making it harder for ourselves, ensuring the "worst" manifestation (and therefore max-novelty once again).
    so, for example, imagine that we go off into zero-g and we're all like super chill towards eachother, and we just get used to eachother without any resistance to each other,-- and we're just like together and stuff -- but when it starts, we're back into reaction-only (machine) mode again, where it's max-contrast/noveltty.
    like really, why not take the time while we're in zero-g to build up more constrast for each other, limiting our own cOncepts; like think about it: if we work to limit ourselves further, instead of creating: we end up doing both: staying infinite, and also creating (at the cost/penalty of some extra conflict/drama). (brb)

### 2023-05-24 13:13 - what sort of things do I want to create in the demiurge?

this idea comes to me at the ttop of a fictional story assessment: this entire thing, until it becomes reality, is still a fictional story (and therefore subject tto change). what I mean iss, the imagination filters out a lot of extra information to make the image look really big (it's a very tiny living image/concept that's being magnified/modified/rendered) -- so one *never* sees the whole picture in their imagination, so there are *always* missing pieces that one will come to realise in the reality version of the thing.
  the imagination is a fool, because it feels the way it wants to feel looking at the limited data it can perceive (which is a tiny fraction of what is experienced in reality; reality is so much more visceral and tangible than that);
therefore, everything conceived in the imagination *must be fiction* (no exceptions). the real-life state/experiencce of things   is completely lost in the imagination, where for example, the uncertainty of something is simply *not possible* to feel in the imagtination.
  we (and I'm strongly including myself here) think we can judge probabilities in the imagination, but because the imagination cannot *see* all the data, one must rely on *feeling* to perceive all  of the data .
because of this lack of perceptive capability, it's a very tantalising idea to add another feature to the "imagination" (cause we (at least me) are going to be people without pinecone) that allows it to perceive probability based on feeling.
  I've offered one thought about this, that in the conceptual machines that we're going to be building where we'll essentially communicate with our computers with our heart; obviously we'll have a sort of language -- and one of the features I want it to have is to be able to say phrases and ideas/concepts with a tone of certainty to it.
  having an imagination, we'll have the ability to also send pictures along with that probability as well (with our heart), which will produce a concept which renders that level of destruction in case of the uncertain occurring.
later on, when we jump into their matrix, we'll have pinecone, and there we'll struggle to use the same techniques (cause we're goinyg to be machines, essentially, invading not just the bodies that they've prepared for us, *and* all of the machines they've built -- cause now we're in techno cyber-space), and so the idea is that we create our own disabiling forces stronger than their efforts against us.

one really important to me is to learn a coceptual frame of mind that is *efficient* -- and the reason is, if you just look at life conceptually, so many things are an *enormous waste of time* -- like (from my perspective), it's monumental how much time we waste on bad ideas, or things we're completely uncertain on, or have no influence over anyway.
  I've always perceived life in a form of efficiency -- and so I've learned to be inefficient (not frugal) about things as the abundance of them rises; in an abundance economy, many tthings don't need to be conserved -- where the efficiency is not worth the ttime or money. some things, like a few cents of electricity or whatever don't need to be saved for the loss of some minutes of time. (I just noticed electricity is electric+city).
therefore, the thing that we're creating is a system that helps us to automatically remove inefficient things from our life.
  so, to fight against it, they'll have to try and make us as unefficient, living in the most abundant lifestyle, to ensure we never regain our LOA capablitites.
people like myself (obviously I already have a bunch but I want to make more), will also create their own nemesises to join them in the world, that they'll defeat us regularly at our own game (programmed by us of course), so even in this lush cushy environment, we're swimming in drama because of our symbolic duals. (brb)

---

remember, if they try to fight any of these ideas, it attracts them just the same as if we attract it.
  all I have to do is to have a desire, write it down (or think/say it) and all of a sudden, that capacity is gone.
  we'll make a similar set of integrations into their computers to ensure that this service is provided to us guaranteed,--- that way we can just desire it, and their (computer automated sysytem) fighting against that desire, attracts it for us.

### 2023-05-24 14:23 - the most important thing for me...

one thing that really I find quite undesirable is the necessity for things to go physical so fast; what this really is a question of, actually -- is how intimate are your thoughts? for example allison yesterday admitted that by externalising her imagination out into a book, she felt shame to know what others think/rate her imagination, how it is.
  I'm one of those people that figure stuff out quickly, so what it appears to me that this desire to go physical is all about, is actually insecurity about sharing something so intimate without having a (physical) relationship; inotherwords, it may be possible, that until now, there has never been a man that was allowed into a woman's imagination without having first had a sexual interaction? I find it doubtful, because there are a Lot of people and I imagine it's happened at one point in time or another; so prolly not first, but definitely rare.
imagine how it would be if we were to spend time melding our conceptual world together *before* having a physical relationship. we would actually be able to communicate with each other without words and stuff. after we have sex, it's no fun after that because now all communication is done with pictures, and I don't really care for pictures much (now), so I really would prefer to actually get to know the person, *before* anything happens.
  there are two things to be said about this: nosebook wants to get us into the demiurge as fast as possible locking us into a picture-only (that they control) reality. I'd like to just take a break from pictures for a while -- because I've learned a bunch of stuff and I want to actually implement it.
  second is, I'm reminded of joeseph smith and some of the pushback about him from other women (which is just basically calling them sluts; slaves to their physical urges, unchaste).
    therefore, what's actually more likely to be happening is that they're making these sorts of assessments of how much of a slave to the physical passions that they are, and thinking that everyone is the same -- and see that's where it gets out of the imagination and into the realm of LOA; because there *are* people out there that do not want to just rush in rapidly to a relationship and instead want to actually get to know a person on more than just a superficial (physical) level, and instead have something deeper than that: a kind of heart-to-heart connection (54) with eachother. (brb 14:48)

### 2023-05-24 14:49 - everything we decide to do, will have to be narrated...

so, let's say, for example that, somehow we decide to learn how to have a conceptual communication with each other,-- well,
  for us, it's a heart-to-heart meld, but for them it'll be a brain-to-brain thing where they're sending conepts through the brain side of the heart (3rd ray) instead of the sensual, physical emotions from the heart side (5th ray).
then what they'll need to do is they'll have to come up with a *reason* for why we're abstaining from sex after marriage; they'll make things "marriage rituals" and stuff like that,-- but imagine if we decide to start communicating with eachother in our h2h cconnection -- they'll have to simulate the same thing, going through their (narrative) network implementation, *to ensure everyone's on the same page*.
  so imagine all of the things that we do with each other have now to be encoded into cultural and societal mythologies that they'll grow up on... essentially putting the *minimum requriements* of their demiurge to be a couterfiet of whatever we're doing.
    as an example, imagine now everything as a series of actions:
    1. we get married
    2. we start to hang out with each other and start talking about things
      too much social interaction though, and they''ve got a lot of dialoge to come up with;-- imagine that they're trying to do a sleazy porno inbetween unbelievable -- whatever we're doing (which is hopefully not a lot other than just having sex).
    3. we start doing unbelievable things like moving things with our mind, flying, telepathic communication, etc. -- all *before* having sex!!!
    4. finally, after completely vulcan mind melding eachother together, we have sex.
    5. matrix revolutions.
    huh, that's a basic 5-act structure. seems doable.
  so what I like to do is to have a little fun with my thoughts and let them go a bit to try and figure out how nosebook is narrating my present -- cause
    I'll be honest: I haven't a clue, or even care (I actually kinda like *not knowing* -- cause then I don't know what I need to live up to, so I'm freer to fail).
  some things, I imagine from my point of view are just so wackadoodle, I'd feel pretty bad they're *deceiving* them with inaccurate informatcion (and I've corrected them with LOA explanations before) and they keep telling inaccurate narration of me.
    my desire is to be portrayed in the clearest most transparent ways, and for someone who likes transparency, my concepts are not visible to someone that thinks they need to be hidden; which is why my story is delivered in narrative form, because they need something hidden from them to be able to perceive value in it (because all the best stuff is hidden (joeseph smith)).
  sometimes I've entertained the thought of just producing utter nonsense,-- in fact, even yesterday I considered the idea -- and the funny thing is, it's heading that direction already, so there's nothing to be done. soon, we'll sound like space aliens and you too can dub in all the nonsense you want to pump out (
    chirp, chirp, chi,
    chirp, chirp, chi...: "no"
    chirp, chirp, chirp, chi, chi,
    chirp, chirp, chirp, chi, chi...: "no fun"
    chirp, chirp, chi, chi, chi,
    chirp, chirp, chi, chi, chi...: "never"
    chirp chirp chirp,
    chirp chirp chirp...: "NO"
  ) and then it's all good, cause I can just do what I do (which is believing everything I write/say (cept sometimes I make mistakes -- but like less often all the time))

I wonder if there's a correlation with doing something silly and discovering something new, btw...

#### 2023-05-24 15:46 - redefine marriage

I suppose we could call it that word, "marriage" -- which by definition, is an agreement -- is where we define what it is actually we're creating.
  one has to think about this marriage, not just as a romantic engagement, because it's much more than that;
    the way I see it now is that jaron will represent the narrated-imaginative side of things, where I think they'll start him out in poland, cause possibly that's where one of the chestahedron top three vertices that surround the north pole.
    it is assumed (by me) that probably here or someplace near here will become the south pole, which will point straight toward the sun. our conceptual structure will transform the sunlight in a way, that when it's received by us, it's mostly x-rays and stuff like that which then some will be able to pass through the earth (and that star/desire) and get transformed into the realisation of that desire in conceptual form;
      in a sense, it'll be like a long narrative dream where events just sorta play out in a way in which it feels like your mind is just kinda narrating the event (exactly as I'm doing now), and it'll "just work". it's already been seen by many that they can adjust their desires according to their perceptions, and after that, it'll go into overdrivve.
    which then turns the mind into a resonating machine, where the symbols that match that desire are showing up in more and more rapid fashion (limited by us, of course -- cause the other side can't go faster than us; we're the reflective opposite side). it'll get even ccooler, I tell you.
  and really, the way that we agree to be with each other will form the resonant "upper limit" to the speed of thought;
    because it needs to be carried in conceptual form,
    and because light received is only as good as its reflector.
  essentially, the way that we work together will produce the "ideal" frequency of their thought. the north pole will get a transformed (through narrative) version of that concept, suitable for their frequency (cause they're not where we're at, and it's OK)
    the cool thing about the northern hemisphere is that it'll be twilight there (like all moody, like it is at sunset/sunrise), pretty much all the time, with a very strange(?) day cycle (cause the axis is offset from vertical: energy coming down one of the top 3 tetrahedron/chestahedron verticies down to the central south pole), so a rotation will wobble the day a bit, and for us, we'll always have the same sky: daylight.
  in essence, we're talking about two completely different style of thinking: we're in the "every thing/concept is connected" point of view, so we see all things as connecting and working together to make what we want, and they're seeing all the symbols necessary to guide them toward their destiny (whoever/whatever/wherever they think that is).
all of the things that we use and make use of, will have to be explained (or hidden out of sight) in their narrative, because they have to present a limited view of reality, where nothing is it's essence, but instead an implementation of a thing.
therefore, we should create some really cool stuff, cause we're their next demiurge... cause as soon as our star pops, we're going to descend/instantiate into their world and find our way through their matrix.

so what we have here is two sides of the earth, both in each others' matrix. one side is fully open and receptive and wants to turn everything into happiness,sunshine,&rainbows. the other side (completely occulted from us) perceives the symbols that our conceptual environment composes
  so, each concept is some ammount resonant with every symbol out there, which means that the more that concept is output by us, they'll feel the symbols that resonate with that concept
    (minus some tilt of the earth along that bent axis).
  and to them, if their desires (ie, what they're looking for) resonate with those symbols, that reality is happening fast,
  but when we're not making the symbols for their desires, they have to find a way of making them,
    I think they rely on sex, magic, incantations, poetry, narration, and (all manners of conditions) to pump up the symbols related to what they want.
  however, you can imagine from their perspective, if they're being pounded by a bunch of symbols that they don't like, they have to find a way of turning that unwanted symbol into a wanted symbol, so it narrates the redefinition in, instead.
  most people who don't know that about narrative reality, think that the symbols are "real" and that's why they manifest -- not because the order was right or the incantation was real -- but because the symbols in front of the eyes can be seen in a way that's desirable/tolerable and don't cause them fear, and so they live in fear, from not having defined the symbols in front of their eyes.

### 2023-05-25 15:12 - I want to become even more basic, not complexify

today, I woke up thinking about the idea of bassanio: in it, he's got to pick from one of the three coffins, and the correct choice is the lead one.
  one thing I've noticed in my exploration of myself as a centre, is that I'm quite notably an actor of a lot of people. I take what they do and copy it (shamelessly), and just implement it (very much like a child does).
    I also seem to perceive everything (past,present&future) as all happening "now"
  and so what's important about that is I take the lead position, naturally because I'm constantly trying to figure out how to implement someone else's idea into my experience: I simply copy them and just make improvements as I go along.
  ---
  the problem with the silvers is thatt they're simply not a good enough reflection --
    and so yesterday, jaron showed me the venn diagram of preachers, bank robbers, and DJs; it's obvious that the DJ is the reflector, and one of the many reactions to that experience is a note about how ineffective reflectors (like DJs, social media influencers, etc.) are at actually reflecting tthe society/culture/idea that they're copying/modifying/remixing/creating and putting/encoding into different mediums (sound,music,visuals,etc.) -- and to be very clear it's not possible to ever be as good of a reflector as the transmission/bitrate/transfer medium is capable of -- and when it comes to using technology to reflect our ideas out into the world, we're locked into the limitations of the format/medium that we choose to express ourselves into.
    in addition to that experience, I'd like to recall the dramatic realisation of what it would be like if I started a podcast, or wanted to [create a website](/blartr.md), or whatever -- and all of a sudden, it became realised that I would behave as a reflection of that medium as well (here typing, I just do m/ own thing).
  and the problem with the gold ones is that they're not *actually* gold -- just pretending to be
    like most preachers are; in fact, I've noticed a dramatic correlation between the actor and the charactor, becuase they reflectt the other quite a bit (because of the quality of the reflector). so, for example, most peachers can be compared to bank robbers (or sales people) because of the medium/concept of exchange medium/concept we call money.
  and so bassanio eventually picks the lead coffin and in it reads that he did not look for physical beauty/appearance but instead noticed that they're a counterfiet (poor reflection) of portia; and so, by choosing the counterfiet, he gets portia.
  as a result, I've been trying to figure the counterfiet thing out, and so [one of the ways I tried to reason this](/blartr.md#2023-05-21-2300---a-narrative-idea) was to try and find a way to make them "actual gold", for it to work.
so this morning, the thought that came into my head is that I should think of the peruvians as counterfiet. immediately, I rejected the idea. later upon reasoning it out, I tried to fivgure out why I didn't like the idea so much. I listed some reasons:
  - not attractive -- but then noted that the're probably not going to be doing the "desire me for my physical appearance" thing that is common in "western thought" (not sure where to draw the line there -- cause maybe more than just western) and so I wouldn't have nearly the same problem [I've been trying to solve](#2023-05-24-1449---everything-we-decide-to-do-will-have-to-be-narrated) with an agreement on more than just physical things (like a marriage vow puts significant restrictions on emottional interchange).
  - nothing in common with me -- noting that I usually find something in common with almost everyone that I encounter, but with the peruvians I knew, (though great people), I didn't find I had any commonalities with them at all.
and all of those reasons are "real" inside my head, but then later on (after smoking a bit and thinking about it), I realised that maybe I have some commonalitites with them. (brb)

### 2023-05-25 19:11 - they don't know how to narrate it, if it doesn't involve sex
I started to try out the peruvian angle a bit in my imagination (never a good idea), because I don't know -- then later on, I went upstairs to eat a sandwitch and thoughts popped into my head over and over about trying out a different (again with a white/silver girl) manifestation and they continue to feel bad to me. no matter how I angle it, the reflector just isn't good enough, and it causes me distress to think about becoming a reflection of a poor reflector.
  in contrast, I was thinking about becoming a reflection of various peruvian girls that I had met -- and really they're not actually all that different than I am -- cause I feel like they're *way better* at not needing the manifestation than the silver girls are, and when it comes to finding someone that I can get into a conceptual zone with, it's definitely going to be more the brown spanish speakers than the white ones -- as they're quite different in how they feel (even between spain/mexican spanish and south american) -- and I get the sense that this comes from a sort of maternal/cultural zone/mentality that doesn't really get translated into language very well (or used, because it's not really developed).
  therefore, I conclude that it will take far less for a peruvian girl to find herself similar to me in frequency than it would be for the silver girls to get there (especially ones that have psychedellics experience).
    furthermore, for example many of these indiginous(?) don't have as much of a taboo on drugs and shamanic practises. I think it's also difficult for them to narrate a cultural scene that's more like a tribe than a top-down governed society (it creates problems because the model is all different: drugs and no leaders? sounds like a disaster)
in contrast, if we could just sorta start living together and organising it into a culture tthat we're all apart of before doing anything physical. I think that could be best, because by that time, I become a reflection of them (who are also not good reflectors[^1]) -- and the image that I was seeing, simply is that me integrating into the spanish culture again will slow me down *so much* (compared to how I am now) and because I'm now tied to a culture that is (inherently, because of their language[^2] (I think)), slowed down greatly.

[1]: I make this claim because (I'm being racist here) with white/silver girls, I start to become a reflection of whatever they're a reflection of (their culture, family, last lover, social/television/news media, etc.) and I simply can't be constantly changing based on whatever new thing they're reflecting; so the darker they are, I noticed the easier it is to reflect them back to them.
[2]: spanish uses symbols and symbolism very heavily, so it's extremely difficult to express a concept (which resonates with many symbols, sometimes with equal intensity). the way to speak in a way that has multiple layers of interpretation is to speak *conceptually* (or in metaphors/parables); because each layer resonates with it's corresponding symbols. I noticed with dani (who became quite conceptual), he found it difficult to express some concepts in spanish that didn't fit exactly with tthe symbol it's evoking. therefore, it's my postulation, that because white people seemingly have symbolic (3-4th ray perception) kinda built into their DNA, a lot of the more earth tones people struggle with latin/romantic and other symbolic languages. it would be my goal to find a way to bring concepts into their percetion, obviously.

### let's see if we can make a worse one, though...
