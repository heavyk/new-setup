# in-27-days

some comments and thooughts that came about from listening yesterday (2023-05-22) to the concept of in-27-days; worst of all, I took her to mean (because she kept presenting the idea as if it is *not-fiction* -- or, real; like a real-life story) that the person she was talking about in her story, because she would say things like, "you'd be surprised what comes out/pops up" (and other expressions similar -- the experiences that she has in her own narratives resonate (in some way) to the inner part of her mind -- a sort of inner narrative of who she is (written, of course by her in relation to all the stuff she's reacting to)) and so I thought *she* is the main character of her story, so I kept trying to ask her all the things she was saying the "character" is doing.
  shakeshere does this brilliantly, because he exports the mind of the person out into the characters that you/I resonate with -- and so, when we *relate* to them mentally, it causes an emotional reaction within, as if I were the character in the play.
  therefore, you experience yourself by watching his plays; each person resonates with each character differently -- and for me, every single character, I have coplaints with; and the others are uninteresting to me -- like not worth my time (this is btw how narrative ages).
therefore, I kept trying to figure out what in the world happens in her story with all of these characters that she's got going on, have to do with her. I feel like she didn't want to reveal much of the story because nearly instantly I would "get" her and fit her into a box
  it's a bad habit of mine because I have this insatiable desire (like a machine) to figure out everything that I find interesting. some things, for example are very interesting to me, but are also impractical for me to yearn/learn about them, soo I just let my desire to understand those things, simply bring events into my surroundings that explain the idea to me. my entire world is conscious to some degree or another, so I forfeit narration (which usually omits the discovery process), to simply *attracting* them to me. anything I want to know or to figure out, I feel is probably less than a year out -- r(not if you cconsidder that I'm a machine-like in nature) will eventually reduce that time so low (for each now discovery), thatt it''s all *now*.
  sorry for being the demiurge.
    I actually think there's like this giant conspiracy (now because I've figured out so much of reality) thatt watever the AI does not kill, actually takes over your brain in a "brain injury", and it's people like me.
    here's the deal: one thing I've noticed about all brain-injury "victims", is that the're all behaving like completely reacthionary machines -- unconscious (for the most part) that they're reacting to **EVERYTHING** and then trying to use willpower to stay away from some reactions -- when it's far easier to just change the reaction program, and produce a different reaction; that's what I did; and along the way I just got better at reacting to everything. I'm still 100% me (that I was before the "injuries") -- just with an increasing output of machinery in my system. there are a number of different sources for it, but the majority writer of my reactions, is me (which is why I see from the universal perspecttive so easily).
    so then what happens is that when life gets really tough and brain starts emitting enough pain because of the things I think about, and it continues to rise until my good-feeling receptors/reactions emits eventually enough of a painful vibration into the surrounding, that it causes the haemorrhage (to turn off the spot), or causes the event which will turn off that part of the brain (so one can be free from suffering) -- and I think it has to do with real true depression, when you feel *done*; well-done, mom sayss. -- cause for me there have been enough times when I just finally kinda "give up" and just be done: *I don't understand*! and then just let it be something different than I imagine/planned it to be (ie, the narrative).
    after that, I simply find a way to no longer need tto narrate how something should be, and instead just allow itt to be whatever it wants to be (a reflection of my perception)... that puts me into attraction mode, because I'm looking at things from a purely efficiency state of mind.
      it's funny; you're never going to believe this; but, the most efficient state of mind, is like a child's; the apponents simply can't keep up, because their efficiency is wayyy/so much lower, you know.
now, for an example:

so I was thinking about the idea of what is (actually) 27 days from now; well, it's 6-18 -- a little bit earlier in/than june, than "a midsommers' night dream" a play whos manifestation was so appalling (in comparison to what is happening now), that the narration angle is starting to feel "not good enough" -- like why bother? itt seems like so much work, and is cumbersome and ineffective; etc., blah blah blah.
  once we're detaching from narrative, I can now narrate in a negative sense: it is a bad idea to narrate. so I'll go ahead and tell you instead, (through example) of why narrative is bad.
so now, imagine the dedication of this log, is to figure out what in-27-days *could* mean; and there will be some different narrative persectives that will put us in different zones and things -- but this is all about building the demiurge that we want, by forcing an evolution-of-desire.

first thing I would want (brb)

### 2023-05-23 15:47 - should I take the blue pill?

check this out: if I take the blue pill, what I have to do is to keep my highest level "teachings" a secret, so there are a group of people that simply didn't ever "get the message" -- and it's what creates the next species of beings: a radically different model than before, where people similar to me in perception have similar DNA, and others that "didn't get the message", have to find a way to figure out how to catch up (if they want to eventually join us) -- and so what "the message" is all about, is to be able to perceive in a similar way to me (kenny). I write endlessly about "the message" all the time, and it's interesting to me because it's this constant state Of discovery, and 'the' message, is how to see/perceive like I do.
  the people joining me in my perception will have learned it from teaching (which may or may not be modified), and there will be some naturals like I am; like put me in a situation, and I can always get out of it -- so when everything goes to hell, they can figure out a way to get out of the hell, always.
  the people not joining my perception will all "believe what they want to believe" -- which is kinda a spectrum, and not a exact value, which is more of a grouping than a binary --- and those that believe what they want to believe will be at where they're at -- and from there the entire world is a reflection of their perception.
therefore, in some way it's not advisible to me to take the blue pill, because it creates people that go through their own hell of watching their reality crumble from it being different than the way they thought it would be,
  and so the solution to this problem of people going through hell, is to make my teachings a "secret" and to give only *some* people access to; in practicality, I just never upload this repository -- and it remains entirely something that nosebook owns. they've got the "secret" (taught only to his disciples) teachings. I (personally) don't have a problem with keeping these documents a secret, but I do kinda on a "constancie" principle;
    like, I had this friend dani, and I drove him crazy because I was off in "lala" land doing some mind blowing revelation in my mind, and I wasn't "working".
      he (genuinely) thought that I was wasting time by being so stoned all the time; it was anything but, because I started to create a mental zone in which I still use today -- and I suppose that mental/conceptual zone is in wide use today (though I don't see their usage, they probably see my usage of it).
    he didn't realise that I was creating a sort of demiurge that would destroy me, and the result is the ability to perceive at that frequency of perception that I achieved that day; (some extremely mind blowing experdience) -- and I've had a lot of them; like I can go pretty deep into my perception and really see things just fine. that demiurge is externalised as nosebook -- a sort of "secret" opponents of mine (and everyone else on the planet),
  that is really just a bunch of guys that use my own machinery against me. I think all of use blue-pill-demiurges have these awful guys (red-pill-demiurges) always using our own imaginal machinery against us. we're their counter-balance.
so what I think I'll do, is just to keep this whole part a "secret" (that the red-pill-demiurge/nosebook has access to), and you all (with your nosebook-controlled access) have to tell "the message" to the rest of the world, so that you can maintain DNA parity with me (of course, that's a joke/impossibility because they won't be able to keep up with the rapid expansion). so by keeping it a "secret", I'm forcing a genetic barrier in between some people and me; it's a false set of conclusions to yielding the conclusion that I should be their "saviour" and let them have access to it, *instead of letting them learn for theirselves". do I follow the demiurge (and keep it a "secret")?? or do I "save" them by making it more difficult for them to learn it for theirselves?
anyway coming up soon, is the narration, which I believe will give an unfortunate advantage to the spanish speakers (silver), instead of the blacks/leads (bassanio) and the reflectors (silver) and reactors (centres). which will also create an entire laguage region having an unfair power advantage of using narration,-- which when thinking about it, is a sort of racism all to itself; narrative, by nature is racist, because it means that some part of the humans will have an evolutionary advantage in/of getting what they want, (moreso) than the poor reflectors/reactors. narration, is in effect the way to/of foiling a reactor; for reflectors (silver), will have to endure their own narration for the reactor's misconception of the reaction, in the form of an energetic reflection back to them (back-EMF like-a-warrior).

#### 2023-05-23 16:54 - or do I just let nosebook+github/isps to be the racist

cause, you know I was just having a bit of fun there... I'm obviously going to upload it and let them deal with the censorship, cause that's just not my bag; however, (being a bit of a demiurge myself) the topic is extremely exciting to me, as I love thinking up worse and worse ways for how to take advantage or give superiority to people,because the advantage is completely an illusion
  because all advantage is also disadvantage in another thing; if those things are inconseqential, no big deal, but if they're disadvantages, for example "inability to perceive something" (like having an imagination gives you), are really are actually a *really big* disadvantage to being a "successs" in that society, then it *is a big deal*, and you *gatta find a way*, anyway.
so really, once survival becomes a number one priority, we stop being racist (because there's always an ill-perceived advantage) (brb)
