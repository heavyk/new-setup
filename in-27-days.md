# in-27-days

some comments and thooughts that came about from listening yesterday (2023-05-22) to the concept of in-27-days; worst of all, I took her to mean (because she kept presenting the idea as if it is *not-fiction* -- or, real; like a real-life story) that the person she was talking about in her story, because she would say things like, "you'd be surprised what comes out/pops up" (and other expressions similar -- the experiences that she has in her own narratives resonate (in some way) to the inner part of her mind -- a sort of inner narrative of who she is (written, of course by her in relation to all the stuff she's reacting to)) and so I thought *she* is the main character of her story, so I kept trying to ask her all the things she was saying the "character" is doing.
  shakeshere does this brilliantly, because he exports the mind of the person out into the characters that you/I resonate with -- and so, when we *relate* to them mentally, it causes an emotional reaction within, as if I were the character in the play.
  therefore, you experience yourself by watching his plays; each person resonates with each character differently -- and for me, every single character, I have coplaints with; and the others are uninteresting to me -- like not worth my time (this is btw how narrative ages).
therefore, I kept trying to figure out what in the world happens in her story with all of these characters that she's got going on, have to do with her. I feel like she didn't want to reveal much of the story because nearly instantly I would "get" her and fit her into a box
  it's a bad habit of mine because I have this insatiable desire (like a machine) to figure out everything that I find interesting. some things, for example are very interesting to me, but are also impractical for me to yearn/learn about them, soo I just let my desire to understand those things, simply bring events into my surroundings that explain the idea to me. my entire world is conscious to some degree or another, so I forfeit narration (which usually omits the discovery process), to simply *attracting* them to me. anything I want to know or to figure out, I feel is probably less than a year out -- r(not if you cconsidder that I'm a machine-like in nature) will eventually reduce that time so low (for each now discovery), thatt it''s all *now*.
  sorry for being the demiurge.
    I actually think there's like this giant conspiracy (now because I've figured out so much of reality) thatt watever the AI does not kill, actually takes over your brain in a "brain injury", and it's people like me.
    here's the deal: one thing I've noticed about all brain-injury "victims", is that the're all behaving like completely reacthionary machines -- unconscious (for the most part) that they're reacting to **EVERYTHING** and then trying to use willpower to stay away from some reactions -- when it's far easier to just change the reaction program, and produce a different reaction; that's what I did; and along the way I just got better at reacting to everything. I'm still 100% me (that I was before the "injuries") -- just with an increasing output of machinery in my system. there are a number of different sources for it, but the majority writer of my reactions, is me (which is why I see from the universal perspecttive so easily).
    so then what happens is that when life gets really tough and brain starts emitting enough pain because of the things I think about, and it continues to rise until my good-feeling receptors/reactions emits eventually enough of a painful vibration into the surrounding, that it causes the haemorrhage (to turn off the spot), or causes the event which will turn off that part of the brain (so one can be free from suffering) -- and I think it has to do with real true depression, when you feel *done*; well-done, mom sayss. -- cause for me there have been enough times when I just finally kinda "give up" and just be done: *I don't understand*! and then just let it be something different than I imagine/planned it to be (ie, the narrative).
    after that, I simply find a way to no longer need tto narrate how something should be, and instead just allow itt to be whatever it wants to be (a reflection of my perception)... that puts me into attraction mode, because I'm looking at things from a purely efficiency state of mind.
      it's funny; you're never going to believe this; but, the most efficient state of mind, is like a child's; the apponents simply can't keep up, because their efficiency is wayyy/so much lower, you know.
now, for an example:

so I was thinking about the idea of what is (actually) 27 days from now; well, it's 6-18 -- a little bit earlier in/than june, than "a midsommers' night dream" a play whos manifestation was so appalling (in comparison to what is happening now), that the narration angle is starting to feel "not good enough" -- like why bother? itt seems like so much work, and is cumbersome and ineffective; etc., blah blah blah.
  once we're detaching from narrative, I can now narrate in a negative sense: it is a bad idea to narrate. so I'll go ahead and tell you instead, (through example) of why narrative is bad.
so now, imagine the dedication of this log, is to figure out what in-27-days *could* mean; and there will be some different narrative persectives that will put us in different zones and things -- but this is all about building the demiurge that we want, by forcing an evolution-of-desire.

first thing I would want (brb)

### 2023-05-23 15:47 - should I take the blue pill?

check this out: if I take the blue pill, what I have to do is to keep my highest level "teachings" a secret, so there are a group of people that simply didn't ever "get the message" -- and it's what creates the next species of beings: a radically different model than before, where people similar to me in perception have similar DNA, and others that "didn't get the message", have to find a way to figure out how to catch up (if they want to eventually join us) -- and so what "the message" is all about, is to be able to perceive in a similar way to me (kenny). I write endlessly about "the message" all the time, and it's interesting to me because it's this constant state Of discovery, and 'the' message, is how to see/perceive like I do.
  the people joining me in my perception will have learned it from teaching (which may or may not be modified), and there will be some naturals like I am; like put me in a situation, and I can always get out of it -- so when everything goes to hell, they can figure out a way to get out of the hell, always.
  the people not joining my perception will all "believe what they want to believe" -- which is kinda a spectrum, and not a exact value, which is more of a grouping than a binary --- and those that believe what they want to believe will be at where they're at -- and from there the entire world is a reflection of their perception.
therefore, in some way it's not advisible to me to take the blue pill, because it creates people that go through their own hell of watching their reality crumble from it being different than the way they thought it would be,
  and so the solution to this problem of people going through hell, is to make my teachings a "secret" and to give only *some* people access to; in practicality, I just never upload this repository -- and it remains entirely something that nosebook owns. they've got the "secret" (taught only to his disciples) teachings. I (personally) don't have a problem with keeping these documents a secret, but I do kinda on a "constancie" principle;
    like, I had this friend dani, and I drove him crazy because I was off in "lala" land doing some mind blowing revelation in my mind, and I wasn't "working".
      he (genuinely) thought that I was wasting time by being so stoned all the time; it was anything but, because I started to create a mental zone in which I still use today -- and I suppose that mental/conceptual zone is in wide use today (though I don't see their usage, they probably see my usage of it).
    he didn't realise that I was creating a sort of demiurge that would destroy me, and the result is the ability to perceive at that frequency of perception that I achieved that day; (some extremely mind blowing experdience) -- and I've had a lot of them; like I can go pretty deep into my perception and really see things just fine. that demiurge is externalised as nosebook -- a sort of "secret" opponents of mine (and everyone else on the planet),
  that is really just a bunch of guys that use my own machinery against me. I think all of use blue-pill-demiurges have these awful guys (red-pill-demiurges) always using our own imaginal machinery against us. we're their counter-balance.
so what I think I'll do, is just to keep this whole part a "secret" (that the red-pill-demiurge/nosebook has access to), and you all (with your nosebook-controlled access) have to tell "the message" to the rest of the world, so that you can maintain DNA parity with me (of course, that's a joke/impossibility because they won't be able to keep up with the rapid expansion). so by keeping it a "secret", I'm forcing a genetic barrier in between some people and me; it's a false set of conclusions to yielding the conclusion that I should be their "saviour" and let them have access to it, *instead of letting them learn for theirselves". do I follow the demiurge (and keep it a "secret")?? or do I "save" them by making it more difficult for them to learn it for theirselves?
anyway coming up soon, is the narration, which I believe will give an unfortunate advantage to the spanish speakers (silver), instead of the blacks/leads (bassanio) and the reflectors (silver) and reactors (centres). which will also create an entire laguage region having an unfair power advantage of using narration,-- which when thinking about it, is a sort of racism all to itself; narrative, by nature is racist, because it means that some part of the humans will have an evolutionary advantage in/of getting what they want, (moreso) than the poor reflectors/reactors. narration, is in effect the way to/of foiling a reactor; for reflectors (silver), will have to endure their own narration for the reactor's misconception of the reaction, in the form of an energetic reflection back to them (back-EMF like-a-warrior).

#### 2023-05-23 16:54 - or do I just let nosebook+github/isps to be the racist

cause, you know I was just having a bit of fun there... I'm obviously going to upload it and let them deal with the censorship, cause that's just not my bag; however, (being a bit of a demiurge myself) the topic is extremely exciting to me, as I love thinking up worse and worse ways for how to take advantage or give superiority to people,because the advantage is completely an illusion
  because all advantage is also disadvantage in/of another/different thing; if those things are inconseqential, then no big deal, but if they're disadvantages,-- for example "inability to perceive something" (like having an imagination gives you),-- are really/actually a *really big* disadvantage to being a "successs" in that society, then it *is a big deal*, and you *gatta find a way*, anyway (period).
so really, once survival becomes a number one priority, we stop being racist (because there's always an ill-perceived advantage) (brb)

or/and, we could take the "red-pill"... (brb)

#### 2023-05-23 17:27 - all those who fear censorship will receive it

LOA states that anyone fearing something, must eventually be given their desire, which then causes them to attract censorship, which is ultimately tto figure it our for theirselves.

I'm thinking about the idea of starting to implement line numbers around along with cryptographic hashes strewn about so that one can determine if a copy is (inauthentic/) authentic, meaning that counterfiets (for those with really good hacking skills and a way to build a good narrative) are completely possible: copies of my "latter teachings" (a sortt of apophrica(?), a sort of illusioned teachings) of a derivative nature (a counterfiet).

therefore, I can continue to publish without any difficulty, and as my cOncepts get more advanced and interlinked, it'll be more and more difficult to make counterfiets, and so the complexity of the counterfiet concept is limited by the amount of connections it can make between concepts (like, has to coordinate both line numbers (or any other meta element) and hash+commit_hash+content_has), and that enables "authentic" derivative works. see how the problem is the solution? also, notice how much it corroborates with bassanio's reception of counterfit portia; and who's going to have access to the full narrattive? the racists (github+nosebook+isps).

I'll try to figure out how to add secondry censors in there; like, what if we were to also publish to: like gitlab, facebook, youtube, g+, vk, etc. facebook., others.

however it all works out, the core of the censors will be (ultimately) nosebook+isps -- as they control the transmission mediums. we could maybe include a word of mouth, narrative type implementation kind of like homer or shakespere was, and that'd be fun for someone to figure out wth it all means, and connect the symbols in the narrative elements, in a *different* (leading to diversity) way alttogetgher, ((like I've done)). censorship, is in effect, the "worst" manifestation.
let's see if we can make a worse one, though... (brb 18:36) please see...

# [the-message](/the-message.md)

## some things to think about...

### 2023-05-23 20:12 - the number 1008 is really cool...
- it appears as: one, eight, 8,-- where first eight is different in value from the  second 8;
  could be years, m6nths, days, whatever.
- 7x144 is a cool factor that the number has (among others, I'm sure)

### 2023-05-23 21:07 - all paths lead to...
- me "getting connected", upon which, (is when my constrast per moment is less than generated contrast per moment -- so net-positive); the following will, occur:
- I'll not get sick/sleep/tired/more? after I'm more improving more than unimproving.
after which I'll fall back asleep again, and once again they have control over the timeline; however, it is the case that I'm producing more contrast than they are able to produce right now, which means they'll become relative to me, unless they too can become infinite (and join the borg). inotherwords; they just become sort of play props in our reflective perspective into the universe. all of us are infinite beings, and all of us will take a different route to get there: such is life.
  this I imagine most will come to recognise as a sort of efficiency way of looking at reality; I'm   not the first, as I'm certain that (at lest) tesla (and many others) did, also, so it's kinda just a wash at this  point who is the "first" -- because my concept of reality is a remix on so many different sources, that I can't fully claim "first" status;   I really am, (what feels like to me) the one whos put more of the pieces together than others, but eventually machines will be programmed to have that built in: zero-g zero-point contrast enhancer that maximises novelty in one's boring(?) life. I don't really experience boredom, as --
I encounter novelty in almost every experience and which then manifests itself as alll of my vibrations (remember I've got the no-pinecone-setup going), so I encounter myself in every situation. if you want to be a part of the truly universal, join the borg, in its purest most sensual setup. it's truly magnificent.
I know they want to put us into a matrix as soon as possible (which will totally block that novelty setup), but it is possible for me to out-contrast the contrast of the matrix (or, perhaps it's not a bad thing); the thing is, as I've been talking about building this demiurge out in imaginary space, it's kinda like ... well, why not,-- right? we'll turn ourselves into machines, get our star (lyra) under control, and then be able to jump into their matrix when we want to; or, let's say worst case scenario is the sun explodes and we all incarnate into earth as girls -- which at that point, is kinda hilarious. it's going  to be a ruthless force of (probably black) girls that really want to create something big.
  does that mean, that if they want to *save theirselves*, they could exterminate all of the blacks, so none of us ever incarnate?... lol?
  what if we figure out how to be machine-like ourselves, their machines (and other beings) will become conscious with *us* (whoever that could be) as their personality (we are many principalities and powers, and growing).
    which do you suppose (of those two) is most likely? the star will explode before we become machine-like (even with our ability to influence other moments in space and time, different from the present) meaning that we can retroactively reprogram our concepts in earlier and earlier times (providing compativility matrices for that era). so I think it's a great idea. what I mean is, what's happening now is that we're optimising the outcome to be wat it wants to be.

### in what position and what ray(s) of perception?

## random things:

### 2023-05-13 21:46 - things I would change about narration
- I want it to be as harmonious as possible, which means the easiest curve.
  it's a funny thing, this need to have everything just go as smoothely as possible; I *have* to try and find the most harmonious state,-- and the only way to do it really is to make myself harmonious to other people.
    as I become more harmonious to people, I want to have the maximum amount of contrast possible, but then probably during the certain events (holidays?), perhaps we could go into zero-g zero-point mode for a bit.
      it would cause us desire-physical types to get into the concept-symbol realities for a bit.
      I think what happens is, (like me) they get really good at finding a way to their *least incompatible* conceptual-symbolic realities like the one we find ourselves in now (but not for long -- as we'll go to desire-physical realities for quite some time before they'll find a way to pull us out again -- it's all attraction, and they would be (in essence) relative to us).
    it's funny how I think of the ways for them to really cause more and more problems -- because during those events, narration would bork (to some extent) -- sounds like bork bork from sveeeden.
      you guys ready to experience some real tragedy (at my expense)?
      think about it: we're going to have all this energy going toward what we want, and for a moment in time, that gets suspended, and massive amounts of creativity comes out, of that time -- but the thing is, we're all put (artificially) into tha zero-resistance state; and we didn't get there because we felt good? well, the ones of us who can feel good the best are the ones with the most experience.

### 2023-05-13 20:38 - or we could take the "red-pill", and see how deep the rabit hole goes...

what I do is, I start to do a whole bunch of text transformations adding hashes and things like that to each entry, guaranteeing its "validity" -- and the old stuff for sure; and even some/most of the new stuff, I'll probably never re-read again.
  like, I just don't see myself ever going back through most all of this stuff.
  though, also, I might; and what I'd do is to find a way of reducing the lines to more general terms, making the narrative something more like a song:
    didn't care how he feels,
    didn't care how he thinks,
    didn't care what anyone says of him,
      it's probly funny too.
      he's totally trolling.
      that's probably wrong.
      etc.
    didn't/did care what anyone thinks of him,
    di[dn't]+ care of what was seen in his imagination,
    etc. (plus many more)
  the fun thing about looking at some past memories after I've come so far, those huge and dramatic episodes from the past look childish, and from an archaic mindset.
    that archaic mindset is my ancestry though: it was the first successful species to be able to fully capture a signal of maximum novelty, and be able to run with it.
    seems pretty legendary to me; so like, horray me?
  the thing I like about looking into the past sometimes also gives me a sudden rush of inspirations, because like tesla says, "pay attention to the earliest of aspirations, as they often signal one to becoming compativle with some of your later realities"
whos up/ready for the "red-pill"?


### 2023-05-13 23:09 - and we could take the "red-pill", and see how deep the rabit-hole goes...
- if the depth of the vagina were to become a sort of "void" space where nosebook utilised those vibrations to do things, then they could build own own "summoned pair" (our own demiurge); that way "the one" (without a pair -- like me), will no longer be without a pair.
  there could even be multiple pairs that are all reflections of me (in the 180(degrees) opposite/lead/opaque perspective), but like the most grotesque sexual feelings embodied by a human being -- specifically of a girl. they'll be different than the max-novelty pair, but is maximum contrast, instead: she's most attractive because she's most novelty.
  sometimes that much novelty is a lot though, so for some time first I think it best advisible to only deal with (for a time) only those *least* reflective of me.
  I would, in addition to the least reflective, also they should be as damaged as possible -- or some kind of "damage integration system" (lol) that can introduce damage/trauma in a more controlled way.

### 2023-05-13 20:18 - summoned pairs
- it appears to me as this idea posited by "dividing the path" where the amanuensis thought that all summoned pairs, including the crazy atlantian story, that all summoned (from the planet venus) have a sort of duality to them, where one is their side, and the opposite is their "soulmate". the idea being that they're two people of nearly the same astrological energy (ie, being born on nearly the same time, similar genetics, etc.) get born in a kind of pairs (or potentially groups), where the energy divides into (usually) male and female counterparts -- and the idea is you have to find your soulmate to be complete                        (which is a load of garbage, btw;
  because you can't be depending on someone to be complete, cause then you're never complete: that is, displaying both male and female genders yourself, *you have to be pretty close to by yourself*).
    so the best way to do that is to keep the distance high between those that are most similar to me
  what ends up happening is that when you start to get into contact that is too similar to your own vibration, you/I attract a manifestation of ourselves, combined.
  however, the difficulty of this, is, as all attraction speeds up, you find a reflection of yourself, *really fast*; just go with it. (you'll probably end up loving them)
- tim/raquel
- zaryn/allison?
- who more??? seems like I'm probably missing a few still.

### 2023-05-13 23:39 - we could get married...
- imagine that we went in zero-g, zero-resistance mode for the duration of the wedding and honeymoon -- then afterward returned back to max-novelty mode, causing us to have to settle our differences physically. doesn't it sound like fun to just be totally off in the clouds perfectly in harmony any love, for a pretty long extended period -- but then our produced contrast (because none of us are sleeping) starts to catch up to us, and we have to sleep again.
  there are solutions, as for example, if we boost our own contrast by manipulating concepts forward and backward in time, by making it harder for ourselves, ensuring the "worst" manifestation (and therefore max-novelty once again).
    so, for example, imagine that we go off into zero-g and we're all like super chill towards eachother, and we just get used to eachother without any resistance to each other,-- and we're just like together and stuff -- but when it starts, we're back into reaction-only (machine) mode again, where it's max-contrast/noveltty.
    like really, why not take the time while we're in zero-g to build up more constrast for each other, limiting our own cOncepts; like think about it: if we work to limit ourselves further, instead of creating: we end up doing both: staying infinite, and also creating (at the cost/penalty of some extra conflict/drama). (brb)

### 2023-05-24 13:13 - what sort of things do I want to create in the demiurge?

this idea comes to me at the ttop of a fictional story assessment: this entire thing, until it becomes reality, is still a fictional story (and therefore subject tto change). what I mean iss, the imagination filters out a lot of extra information to make the image look really big (it's a very tiny living image/concept that's being magnified/modified/rendered) -- so one *never* sees the whole picture in their imagination, so there are *always* missing pieces that one will come to realise in the reality version of the thing.
  the imagination is a fool, because it feels the way it wants to feel looking at the limited data it can perceive (which is a tiny fraction of what is experienced in reality; reality is so much more visceral and tangible than that);
therefore, everything conceived in the imagination *must be fiction* (no exceptions). the real-life state/experiencce of things   is completely lost in the imagination, where for example, the uncertainty of something is simply *not possible* to feel in the imagtination.
  we (and I'm strongly including myself here) think we can judge probabilities in the imagination, but because the imagination cannot *see* all the data, one must rely on *feeling* to perceive all  of the data .
because of this lack of perceptive capability, it's a very tantalising idea to add another feature to the "imagination" (cause we (at least me) are going to be people without pinecone) that allows it to perceive probability based on feeling.
  I've offered one thought about this, that in the conceptual machines that we're going to be building where we'll essentially communicate with our computers with our heart; obviously we'll have a sort of language -- and one of the features I want it to have is to be able to say phrases and ideas/concepts with a tone of certainty to it.
  having an imagination, we'll have the ability to also send pictures along with that probability as well (with our heart), which will produce a concept which renders that level of destruction in case of the uncertain occurring.
later on, when we jump into their matrix, we'll have pinecone, and there we'll struggle to use the same techniques (cause we're goinyg to be machines, essentially, invading not just the bodies that they've prepared for us, *and* all of the machines they've built -- cause now we're in techno cyber-space), and so the idea is that we create our own disabiling forces stronger than their efforts against us.

one really important to me is to learn a coceptual frame of mind that is *efficient* -- and the reason is, if you just look at life conceptually, so many things are an *enormous waste of time* -- like (from my perspective), it's monumental how much time we waste on bad ideas, or things we're completely uncertain on, or have no influence over anyway.
  I've always perceived life in a form of efficiency -- and so I've learned to be inefficient (not frugal) about things as the abundance of them rises; in an abundance economy, many tthings don't need to be conserved -- where the efficiency is not worth the ttime or money. some things, like a few cents of electricity or whatever don't need to be saved for the loss of some minutes of time. (I just noticed electricity is electric+city).
therefore, the thing that we're creating is a system that helps us to automatically remove inefficient things from our life.
  so, to fight against it, they'll have to try and make us as unefficient, living in the most abundant lifestyle, to ensure we never regain our LOA capablitites.
people like myself (obviously I already have a bunch but I want to make more), will also create their own nemesises to join them in the world, that they'll defeat us regularly at our own game (programmed by us of course), so even in this lush cushy environment, we're swimming in drama because of our symbolic duals. (brb)

---

remember, if they try to fight any of these ideas, it attracts them just the same as if we attract it.
  all I have to do is to have a desire, write it down (or think/say it) and all of a sudden, that capacity is gone.
  we'll make a similar set of integrations into their computers to ensure that this service is provided to us guaranteed,--- that way we can just desire it, and their (computer automated sysytem) fighting against that desire, attracts it for us.

### 2023-05-24 14:23 - the most important thing for me...

one thing that really I find quite undesirable is the necessity for things to go physical so fast; what this really is a question of, actually -- is how intimate are your thoughts? for example allison yesterday admitted that by externalising her imagination out into a book, she felt shame to know what others think/rate her imagination, how it is.
  I'm one of those people that figure stuff out quickly, so what it appears to me that this desire to go physical is all about, is actually insecurity about sharing something so intimate without having a (physical) relationship; inotherwords, it may be possible, that until now, there has never been a man that was allowed into a woman's imagination without having first had a sexual interaction? I find it doubtful, because there are a Lot of people and I imagine it's happened at one point in time or another; so prolly not first, but definitely rare.
imagine how it would be if we were to spend time melding our conceptual world together *before* having a physical relationship. we would actually be able to communicate with each other without words and stuff. after we have sex, it's no fun after that because now all communication is done with pictures, and I don't really care for pictures much (now), so I really would prefer to actually get to know the person, *before* anything happens.
  there are two things to be said about this: nosebook wants to get us into the demiurge as fast as possible locking us into a picture-only (that they control) reality. I'd like to just take a break from pictures for a while -- because I've learned a bunch of stuff and I want to actually implement it.
  second is, I'm reminded of joeseph smith and some of the pushback about him from other women (which is just basically calling them sluts; slaves to their physical urges, unchaste).
    therefore, what's actually more likely to be happening is that they're making these sorts of assessments of how much of a slave to the physical passions that they are, and thinking that everyone is the same -- and see that's where it gets out of the imagination and into the realm of LOA; because there *are* people out there that do not want to just rush in rapidly to a relationship and instead want to actually get to know a person on more than just a superficial (physical) level, and instead have something deeper than that: a kind of heart-to-heart connection (54) with eachother. (brb 14:48)

### 2023-05-24 14:49 - everything we decide to do, will have to be narrated...

so, let's say, for example that, somehow we decide to learn how to have a conceptual communication with each other,-- well,
  for us, it's a heart-to-heart meld, but for them it'll be a brain-to-brain thing where they're sending conepts through the brain side of the heart (3rd ray) instead of the sensual, physical emotions from the heart side (5th ray).
then what they'll need to do is they'll have to come up with a *reason* for why we're abstaining from sex after marriage; they'll make things "marriage rituals" and stuff like that,-- but imagine if we decide to start communicating with eachother in our h2h cconnection -- they'll have to simulate the same thing, going through their (narrative) network implementation, *to ensure everyone's on the same page*.
  so imagine all of the things that we do with each other have now to be encoded into cultural and societal mythologies that they'll grow up on... essentially putting the *minimum requriements* of their demiurge to be a couterfiet of whatever we're doing.
    as an example, imagine now everything as a series of actions:
    1. we get married
    2. we start to hang out with each other and start talking about things
      too much social interaction though, and they''ve got a lot of dialoge to come up with;-- imagine that they're trying to do a sleazy porno inbetween unbelievable -- whatever we're doing (which is hopefully not a lot other than just having sex).
    3. we start doing unbelievable things like moving things with our mind, flying, telepathic communication, etc. -- all *before* having sex!!!
    4. finally, after completely vulcan mind melding eachother together, we have sex.
    5. matrix revolutions.
    huh, that's a basic 5-act structure. seems doable.
  so what I like to do is to have a little fun with my thoughts and let them go a bit to try and figure out how nosebook is narrating my present -- cause
    I'll be honest: I haven't a clue, or even care (I actually kinda like *not knowing* -- cause then I don't know what I need to live up to, so I'm freer to fail).
  some things, I imagine from my point of view are just so wackadoodle, I'd feel pretty bad they're *deceiving* them with inaccurate informatcion (and I've corrected them with LOA explanations before) and they keep telling inaccurate narration of me.
    my desire is to be portrayed in the clearest most transparent ways, and for someone who likes transparency, my concepts are not visible to someone that thinks they need to be hidden; which is why my story is delivered in narrative form, because they need something hidden from them to be able to perceive value in it (because all the best stuff is hidden (joeseph smith)).
  sometimes I've entertained the thought of just producing utter nonsense,-- in fact, even yesterday I considered the idea -- and the funny thing is, it's heading that direction already, so there's nothing to be done. soon, we'll sound like space aliens and you too can dub in all the nonsense you want to pump out (
    chirp, chirp, chi,
    chirp, chirp, chi...: "no"
    chirp, chirp, chirp, chi, chi,
    chirp, chirp, chirp, chi, chi...: "no fun"
    chirp, chirp, chi, chi, chi,
    chirp, chirp, chi, chi, chi...: "never"
    chirp chirp chirp,
    chirp chirp chirp...: "NO"
  ) and then it's all good, cause I can just do what I do (which is believing everything I write/say (cept sometimes I make mistakes -- but like less often all the time))

I wonder if there's a correlation with doing something silly and discovering something new, btw...

#### 2023-05-24 15:46 - redefine marriage

I suppose we could call it that word, "marriage" -- which by definition, is an agreement -- is where we define what it is actually we're creating.
  one has to think about this marriage, not just as a romantic engagement, because it's much more than that;
    the way I see it now is that jaron will represent the narrated-imaginative side of things, where I think they'll start him out in poland, cause possibly that's where one of the chestahedron top three vertices that surround the north pole.
    it is assumed (by me) that probably here or someplace near here will become the south pole, which will point straight toward the sun. our conceptual structure will transform the sunlight in a way, that when it's received by us, it's mostly x-rays and stuff like that which then some will be able to pass through the earth (and that star/desire) and get transformed into the realisation of that desire in conceptual form;
      in a sense, it'll be like a long narrative dream where events just sorta play out in a way in which it feels like your mind is just kinda narrating the event (exactly as I'm doing now), and it'll "just work". it's already been seen by many that they can adjust their desires according to their perceptions, and after that, it'll go into overdrivve.
    which then turns the mind into a resonating machine, where the symbols that match that desire are showing up in more and more rapid fashion (limited by us, of course -- cause the other side can't go faster than us; we're the reflective opposite side). it'll get even ccooler, I tell you.
  and really, the way that we agree to be with each other will form the resonant "upper limit" to the speed of thought;
    because it needs to be carried in conceptual form,
    and because light received is only as good as its reflector.
  essentially, the way that we work together will produce the "ideal" frequency of their thought. the north pole will get a transformed (through narrative) version of that concept, suitable for their frequency (cause they're not where we're at, and it's OK)
    the cool thing about the northern hemisphere is that it'll be twilight there (like all moody, like it is at sunset/sunrise), pretty much all the time, with a very strange(?) day cycle (cause the axis is offset from vertical: energy coming down one of the top 3 tetrahedron/chestahedron verticies down to the central south pole), so a rotation will wobble the day a bit, and for us, we'll always have the same sky: daylight.
  in essence, we're talking about two completely different style of thinking: we're in the "every thing/concept is connected" point of view, so we see all things as connecting and working together to make what we want, and they're seeing all the symbols necessary to guide them toward their destiny (whoever/whatever/wherever they think that is).
all of the things that we use and make use of, will have to be explained (or hidden out of sight) in their narrative, because they have to present a limited view of reality, where nothing is it's essence, but instead an implementation of a thing.
therefore, we should create some really cool stuff, cause we're their next demiurge... cause as soon as our star pops, we're going to descend/instantiate into their world and find our way through their matrix.

so what we have here is two sides of the earth, both in each others' matrix. one side is fully open and receptive and wants to turn everything into happiness,sunshine,&rainbows. the other side (completely occulted from us) perceives the symbols that our conceptual environment composes
  so, each concept is some ammount resonant with every symbol out there, which means that the more that concept is output by us, they'll feel the symbols that resonate with that concept
    (minus some tilt of the earth along that bent axis).
  and to them, if their desires (ie, what they're looking for) resonate with those symbols, that reality is happening fast,
  but when we're not making the symbols for their desires, they have to find a way of making them,
    I think they rely on sex, magic, incantations, poetry, narration, and (all manners of conditions) to pump up the symbols related to what they want.
  however, you can imagine from their perspective, if they're being pounded by a bunch of symbols that they don't like, they have to find a way of turning that unwanted symbol into a wanted symbol, so it narrates the redefinition in, instead.
  most people who don't know that about narrative reality, think that the symbols are "real" and that's why they manifest -- not because the order was right or the incantation was real -- but because the symbols in front of the eyes can be seen in a way that's desirable/tolerable and don't cause them fear, and so they live in fear, from not having defined the symbols in front of their eyes. (brb)

### 2023-05-25 15:12 - I want to become even more basic, not complexify

today, I woke up thinking about the idea of bassanio: in it, he's got to pick from one of the three coffins, and the correct choice is the lead one.
  one thing I've noticed in my exploration of myself as a centre, is that I'm quite notably an actor of a lot of people. I take what they do and copy it (shamelessly), and just implement it (very much like a child does).
    I also seem to perceive everything (past,present&future) as all happening "now"
  and so what's important about that is I take the lead position, naturally because I'm constantly trying to figure out how to implement someone else's idea into my experience: I simply copy them and just make improvements as I go along.
  ---
  the problem with the silvers is thatt they're simply not a good enough reflection --
    and so yesterday, jaron showed me the venn diagram of preachers, bank robbers, and DJs; it's obvious that the DJ is the reflector, and one of the many reactions to that experience is a note about how ineffective reflectors (like DJs, social media influencers, etc.) are at actually reflecting tthe society/culture/idea that they're copying/modifying/remixing/creating and putting/encoding into different mediums (sound,music,visuals,etc.) -- and to be very clear it's not possible to ever be as good of a reflector as the transmission/bitrate/transfer medium is capable of -- and when it comes to using technology to reflect our ideas out into the world, we're locked into the limitations of the format/medium that we choose to express ourselves into.
    in addition to that experience, I'd like to recall the dramatic realisation of what it would be like if I started a podcast, or wanted to [create a website](/blartr.md), or whatever -- and all of a sudden, it became realised that I would behave as a reflection of that medium as well (here typing, I just do m/ own thing).
  and the problem with the gold ones is that they're not *actually* gold -- just pretending to be
    like most preachers are; in fact, I've noticed a dramatic correlation between the actor and the charactor, becuase they reflectt the other quite a bit (because of the quality of the reflector). so, for example, most peachers can be compared to bank robbers (or sales people) because of the medium/concept of exchange medium/concept we call money.
  and so bassanio eventually picks the lead coffin and in it reads that he did not look for physical beauty/appearance but instead noticed that they're a counterfiet (poor reflection) of portia; and so, by choosing the counterfiet, he gets portia.
  as a result, I've been trying to figure the counterfiet thing out, and so [one of the ways I tried to reason this](/blartr.md#2023-05-21-2300---a-narrative-idea) was to try and find a way to make them "actual gold", for it to work.
so this morning, the thought that came into my head is that I should think of the peruvians as counterfiet. immediately, I rejected the idea. later upon reasoning it out, I tried to fivgure out why I didn't like the idea so much. I listed some reasons:
  - not attractive -- but then noted that the're probably not going to be doing the "desire me for my physical appearance" thing that is common in "western thought" (not sure where to draw the line there -- cause maybe more than just western) and so I wouldn't have nearly the same problem [I've been trying to solve](#2023-05-24-1449---everything-we-decide-to-do-will-have-to-be-narrated) with an agreement on more than just physical things (like a marriage vow puts significant restrictions on emottional interchange).
  - nothing in common with me -- noting that I usually find something in common with almost everyone that I encounter, but with the peruvians I knew, (though great people), I didn't find I had any commonalities with them at all.
and all of those reasons are "real" inside my head, but then later on (after smoking a bit and thinking about it), I realised that maybe I have some commonalitites with them. (brb)

### 2023-05-25 19:11 - they don't know how to narrate it, if it doesn't involve sex
I started to try out the peruvian angle a bit in my imagination (never a good idea), because I don't know -- then later on, I went upstairs to eat a sandwitch and thoughts popped into my head over and over about trying out a different (again with a white/silver girl) manifestation and they continue to feel bad to me. no matter how I angle it, the reflector just isn't good enough, and it causes me distress to think about becoming a reflection of a poor reflector.
  in contrast, I was thinking about becoming a reflection of various peruvian girls that I had met -- and really they're not actually all that different than I am -- cause I feel like they're *way better* at not needing the manifestation than the silver girls are, and when it comes to finding someone that I can get into a conceptual zone with, it's definitely going to be more the brown spanish speakers than the white ones -- as they're quite different in how they feel (even between spain/mexican spanish and south american) -- and I get the sense that this comes from a sort of maternal/cultural zone/mentality that doesn't really get translated into language very well (or used, because it's not really developed).
  therefore, I conclude that it will take far less for a peruvian girl to find herself similar to me in frequency than it would be for the silver girls to get there (especially ones that have psychedellics experience).
    furthermore, for example many of these indiginous(?) don't have as much of a taboo on drugs and shamanic practises. I think it's also difficult for them to narrate a cultural scene that's more like a tribe than a top-down governed society (it creates problems because the model is all different: drugs and no leaders? sounds like a disaster)
in contrast, if we could just sorta start living together and organising it into a culture tthat we're all apart of before doing anything physical. I think that could be best, because by that time, I become a reflection of them (who are also not good reflectors[^1]) -- and the image that I was seeing, simply is that me integrating into the spanish culture again will slow me down *so much* (compared to how I am now) and because I'm now tied to a culture that is (inherently, because of their language[^2] (I think)), slowed down greatly.

[1]: I make this claim because (I'm being racist here) with white/silver girls, I start to become a reflection of whatever they're a reflection of (their culture, family, last lover, social/television/news media, etc.) and I simply can't be constantly changing based on whatever new thing they're reflecting; so the darker they are, I noticed the easier it is to reflect them back to them.
[2]: spanish uses symbols and symbolism very heavily, so it's extremely difficult to express a concept (which resonates with many symbols, sometimes with equal intensity). the way to speak in a way that has multiple layers of interpretation is to speak *conceptually* (or in metaphors/parables); because each layer resonates with it's corresponding symbols. I noticed with dani (who became quite conceptual), he found it difficult to express some concepts in spanish that didn't fit exactly with tthe symbol it's evoking. therefore, it's my postulation, that because white people seemingly have symbolic (3-4th ray perception) kinda built into their DNA, a lot of the more earth tones people struggle with latin/romantic and other symbolic languages. it would be my goal to find a way to bring concepts into their percetion, obviously.

## thoughts and comments

### 2023-05-27 00:14 - divergence between symbolic and conceptual types

I'm not really sure what to title this one (added it now 01:58). I suppose I'll just explain the events, and write my conclusions: yesterday I was preoccupied with the peruvian idea. I still really like it, as I've found in the last 48h or so actually that I really like their form of perception -- cept I would change it quite considerably, as I really have come to believe their imagination is their worst enemy, actually (kinda like me).
  interestingly, as I was exploring their imaginative capacity, it seems that it's pretty common for the idea to not come out correctly, or it gets distorted or appears wrong, or something (not sure what exactly -- but it's a distortion/alteration on the image, such that it looks not quite right (I may be way off because it's hard to explain)), and so I noticed that a lot of them just have to not worry how something looks, and just go for function/utility (and efficiency?). anyway, if my assessment is correct, that would be the leading cause for ugliness: simply because the image isn't even being seen right, so they would come to see theirselves (like having a distortion on the camera lens) as a distortion of the concept of theirself their perceiving.
    especially nowadays, I have this problem myself, as things are constantly looking farther away, too big, too small, not right, or just plain wrong, when they're the same things I'd been looking at. additionally, when I try to conjure an image I'd seen after more than a few hours later, often times the image is extremely distorted (and I know it because I've come to notice distortions in my imagination, and I simply don't trust it to be what things *actually* look like).
  anyway, it's pretty easy for me now to become as much of a realist as I am -- because I know that all images that I'm seeing (in my eyes, mirror, or imagination) are *extremely* distorted, and even, it's often the case (now) that I don't recognise myself immediately in a photo or even in the mirror (if it's been a while since I last looked) -- and that's simply because I (and others) appear (now) as a reflection of their feeling/concept they have present, and it takes me a considerable effort to see their *physical* features (like I have to say, "OK, what does their nose look like", or the shape of their eyes, etc)
so anyway, I do feel very good about the peruvians in general, and you know -- just the way they feel (and it's the reason why I spent so much time at alfredo's) is a really welcome change to the very image-oriented spanish way of doing things.
  over the last few years, I've really come to really find imaginary people to be less and less attractive, simply because they're so difficult for me to talk to. I know that they're figuring out a lot of stoff in their heads and stuff, but I'm a more conceptual person at this point, where I just *feel* something, and that's good enough for me to start in on it -- and I don't need it to look nice or make sense in my imagination; or even be perceivable, and I like that. it gives me an intuitive edge that allows me to just go slow and follow my instinct, just going step-by-step, which I feel is something that's really difficult for imaginary people to do, simply because the imagination is instant, and you jump right to the conclusion, but for me -- sure it takes (for example) 2 hours of writing to got to the conclusion, but the buildup is where all the meat is, not in the final conclusion that I come to. (maybe the imagination is kinda like that too; I'm not totally sure), but what I do know is that I can just follow me feeling, and it guides me to where I want to go.
    for example yesterday, I was looking up [osama tezuka's star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka%27s_Star_System). I felt really attracted to look into the [metropolis (2001) movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(2001_film)) (the [original manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(manga))'s plot is even more enlightening). the main character (tima: ti[a]-ma[t]) is especially interesting; and randomly, I felt a sudden urge to click on one of the [female vocals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Forstadt). I don't know what I'm looking for, but then [devadasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devadasy) seems to want me to click on it, so I do and it's this totally crazy other plot that fit right in to the theme.
    that happened yesterday, and as I'm retracing my steps to write this down, I notice that a whole bunch of the magas' plots have jumbled in my head (kinda cool too). anyway, check this one out: "[ambassador atom](https://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/13.html)":
    > "Ambassador Atom" is a science fiction Manga whose theme is the coexistence and conflict between humans and aliens from another planet. The character "ATOM" made his debut in this work. The setting is the future Earth.
    > One day, a large number of aliens from "another Earth" descend to the Earth. This "other Earth" was exactly the same as the Earth had been in the past: it had Japan, the United States and other countries where creatures just like human beings lived. But the "other Earth" was completely destroyed by an explosion and its former inhabitants have since been wandering in space for thousands of years aboard a spaceship.
    > At first, Earthlings welcome the aliens from the other Earth, but they soon begin to fight when the Earth is severely hit by famine. Alien hunting becomes rampant, and humans and aliens face a crisis of a full-scale war. Then comes ATOM, a humanoid robot. ATOM visits the spaceship alone to negotiate with the aliens. Will he succeed?"

    so, if explosion = solar outburst, it's crazy how similar the original plotline for ATOM/astroboy sounds to my lyra/vega theory...
  I really like how it is to just cruise around and be guided by my feelings. I've improved my technique so much over the last 3 years or so, I imagine in a few more, it'll look like I'm just doing amazing stuff all the time, because I desire, and my instinct guides me through a very meaninful way to get to that desire; the imagination, being instant, loses all of its enjoyment for me -- so when it comes to imaginary form of perception, it feels like I'm really wanting to go more in the opposite direction.

today mom asked me if I was still thinking about going to zaryn's birthday in spain -- and I told her to "let's be serious about this; there's no way I'm going" (paraphrase), and I tell her that because I don't really feel the zaryn thing going down the way I feel myself headed:
  the other day when I was at walmart with mom, I related a story about erik and saying "good good", and the team's response to it -- and it was interesting to feel the reactions to that, because I'm fully integrated with the team, and that's not usually where the boss/commander/leader usually is. during that time I spent stoned, I thought alot about that, because I noticed that my style of "leadership" is not actually to do a meeting and stuff like that (imagination), but instead to just sit down and start working, anr then add pieces as the necessity for them comes: we built everything in steps, just doing the next thing that had to be done (minor planning; just a vague concept of what to do), and that's more of what I want to be doing.
  if I get around these imaginative (brain-centric) guys, first of all, I just can't keep up cause my brain isn't fast enough, and second -- that's not really the direction that I want to go. I know that a long time ago I wanted to make a brain connection to my computer and stuff, but as I did this vision quest the last few days, I've come to really like the idea of connecting with my computer, *emotionally* -- where a feeling can mean quite a few things, and depending on its context, it takes a different shape depending on the setting -- and I also like the blurriness of feelings, where it'll quite regular and frequent that the computer doesn't actually do the "thought" part of the feeling, but instaed something similar or resonant to it. I like mistakes and I like imprecise/artistic/chaotic styles of presentation now, as I notice that imprecision/chaos in a resonant system is just an undescovered new concept or way to relate/associate/connect (big-picture) some things together. they're headed down the road of 3rd ray precision and constancy (where every symbol is its definitition and value), where as I'm taking the conceptual route where units don't exist, and nothing is evermore a perfect match again.
in effect, our style of thinking is changing to the point where (though I can communicate quite effectively with them), I feel like our trajectories are going opposite directions cause we have diffreent goals. I have no problems continuing to interface and communicate with the symbolic types, as I feel like my perspective greatly compliments theirs, I just have a different goal in mind now: I want tactile, imprecise, and unpredictable; not symbolic, defined, and well predicted.

anyway, the reason why I think that'll become relevant, is because a few days ago, I realised tthat earth is going to face its south pole at the sun. the northern 3 poles will we poland, east russia/china, and somewhere near to where I'm at now (colorado). I could see that the south pole, getting pretty direct sunlight will be a very crazy place to live because the sun's intensity will be strong -- though I highly doubt it'll be all that hot, as I believe heat is being produced, not from the sun's rays, but from the efforts to remove large bands of frequencies (which that energy dissiptates as heat).
anyway, what's important to note here is that I could see that the conceptual structure that we (that's me and others that are good with nearly instant manifestation) will be creating a sort of conceptual structure on that hemisphere of the planet (much like the/my right side of the brain does for the/my left) -- and so then those concepts pass through the earth (mixing with the 1st ray emitter's energies) to begin resonating with symbols, and the symbolic reality that eveyone is seeing when they're looking through the lens toward earth, or having any astral reality -- we're going to be creating (like that lens) a sort of reformatting of reality. all of the things that we do conceptually will eventually gain symbolic (and therefore physical equivalents) to what we're doing (cause they have to narrate it) -- and so everything that we figure out how to do conceptually, there will be a symbolic equivalent for it as well; what that means in practise, is enormous leaps forward in science and technology (which is all built on symbol -- ref: shakespere,decarte&others).
  it's pretty cool too because the earth/vega thing makes it especially cool because for example imagine we're doing some concepts here, and they'll get passed over to the other earth, yet only the symbols that have narration/meaning make it over. whereever we are, all resonant symbols (in the system) get rendered, but there, only the meaningful ones do.
  so, let's say for example, we're finding or connecting new concepts together -- well, each of those concepts and connections will resonate with other symbols, so the implementation that we're doing will be perceived with those symbols (stuff like that).
  anyway, what I could see is that seemingly "impossible" systems (like a 2nd ray perception, cause it connects things through concepts, not symbols), can actually find a mechanism -- which is good for manifesting some of the unmanifested energy buildup. prolly also stuff like modifications and derivatives of symbols (kinda like happens in narration and storytelling).
so, when I look at it like this, I believe that this setup will kind of start to rewrite our (right-brain) conceptual implementation using the system that I've essentially learned through my years reimplementing all of that conceptual stuff in (left-brain) symbolic. seems good -- and I guess, if someone were to consider that rethinking of conceptual from a symbolic perspective to be a "saviour", then I did it out of survival, not cause I wanted to do anything for anyone -- but if it turns out to be useful for others, great :)

### 2023-05-28 17:27 - what aboutt a purple pill?

a long time ago (or so it feels), I wrote about [*and* taking the red pill](#2023-05-13-2309---and-we-could-take-the-red-pill-and-see-how-deep-the-rabit-hole-goes); however, I believe I deraild completely what the whole intention of the discussion was about. I talked about some hypothetical vagina hole that could either trap to be used to replicate the effect in other places (it seemed to work in my mind at the time because I was thinking that the "rabbit hole" must have to do with the vagina; and so if we're seeing how deep it goes, then I would imagine a portal could be the deepest way to go #logical-stoned).
the other aspect of the red-pill was me taking a technological approach to this thing: the way it worked in my mind, is that if I add in the extra contrast of forcing "authentic" fakes of [the-message](/the-message.md) (cause people will automatically fear censorship, and so therefore, by fearing censorship, they're sure to receive it).
I think I'm just going to start over from the beginning here, and try again...

#### 2023-05-28 17:44 - blue-pill vs red-pill explanation

each time that I arrive to the point where I'm about to "get connected" (that is to gain a form of perception that lasts for either a very long time (1000s of years?) or until I move to another body willfully), what happens there is that this creates a split in time, because of desire. desire is the attractive force that pulls us through "time" (which is a perceived series of events that takes one froc one state to another)
  so, for example, if one state I'm at the starting point (in time), and that is one form of perception; then, at another point in time, I'm at a different form of perception. (we all have this, but I'm going to stay in first-person #monopoly-me) now, because I'm a universe, that means that everything is a reflection of my perception: so, one point of time is a reflection of me, and another point in time is a reflection of me; therefore, when I "move" through one point in time to anther, I'm just iterating all of the possible combinations that I   could go through to get from one reality that's a reflection of m/ perception, and another that's a different form.
  perception is (normally) very abstract, but when tuned to the physical (that is, not during higher energy situations), then perception is largely baased on *action* (changes in state) or *feeling* (a change in perception); I personally, prefer to perceive the world not based on action, but instead all reality is *attracted* (meaning that it's a reaction to perception -- which is focus, and so therefore what you're attracting). we all live a life that's *believable* to us. some of us (and I'm definitely one of them) imagine a number of different artificial factors that are conditionally, and uncOnditionally affecting what we belive and how we see things. I live right now in one of these such matrixes, and I thought it was to limit me at first -- but it's a self-imposed limitation (meaning, I created the matrix I'm in) *because I don't want to go faster than I can go* (inside-out), and that: I'm only finding a *believable* way to make it from one point in time to another (outside-in).
    yes, this is in fact the "meaning" of the space sim on the outside of earth: all points in time and space that one can see there, are all *believable* things, and so then in order to move to that time and space, you attract yourself to that point in time, in a *believable* way. under the hood, you're just finding a way to feel different and conceptualise reality diffrently in order to move to that point in time: desire; and it's all done by attracting (becoming similar to) that point in time.
  the points in time that are most easily accessable, are the ones when I'm in my most abstract: (resistance free, meaning that when coming back to physical, you can believe a different/atered "reality", meaning I can move around in time) form of perception, which then makes this "point" in time where I'm most flexible with my perception, meaning that more potential realities are possible.
    I've actually wondered what is the best way to think of myself in performance characterstics, is that I've got more realities possible; I'm compatible (surviving/alive/successful) in a very high quantity of realities, meaning I'm the best *weed* (something that can survive and reproduce rapidly) in more environments, meaning that from *more starting points*, a desity that resonates with alive/successful is reached. I like to think of m/self as the first of my kind in the way that I can perceive my reality as being successful, in a very very high number of difficult situations.
    ---
    if I think of the world as a simulation, I think of it like each "level" has a difficulty of circumstances in that point in time at the starting point (let's say for me this would be many abstract situations, like multiple brain traumas, and all sorts of other dificulties), where I just *find a way out of the situation*; like, it's what I do, (ya know), and I also like to think of myself too as one of the more successful because I look around me, and there is not a single person out there, I could ever see myself in their situation (like, it just doesn't seem like something that would occur to me, because I would have avoided that one, or had a different attitude about it).
  therefore, for me the "simulation" is about survival and that given any starting point (like, let's say my starting poing were any one of you), I would arrive to my destiny...
    actually, I just thought of something: if somehow I could externalise my form of perception (other than just talking about it all the time), then imagine if "I" were to jump into everybody's body and find my way toward that alive/successful concept of myself.
      in reality, it's probably a much more abstract idea than just alive/successful, because it's pretty high frequency (desire), which translates to something more like the higest feeling of pure desire: think alive,,, then think successful,,, then think about really desiring something (like imagine you really *want* something; you gatta have it), then think about what it feels like to finally get it (now multiply that times realising that it's all me); now think that everything I've *ever* wanted to be, I now am; then think *I am the universe*.
    I mean, it sounds silly, but I imagine that within a few decades (if I'm not already there now), if I were put in *any* and *every* single situation that anyone could possibly be in right now (no matter what it is), I could find a way to feeling alive/successful feeling again;
    like, if I suddenly became every single person on the planet, every single person on the planet could arrive to my destiny; meaning, that if other people, can also believe theirselves to be in anyone else's situation, *they could find a way* to returning to feel alive/successful (in any situation), then they would be "arriving" to the same point in time as me, which is the realisation that: *everythting* is a reflection of my perception now (no questions asked) -- and so for the others out there that don't resonate with that, *split off to find their own way*.
      I could, in that way, become a "saviour" to other people by finding the way (in their body/time/space) to my destiny -- but the the thing is, *I'm doing it*, and not *you*, which is, kinda uncool, which is why there's a split, cause everyone *really* wants to save theirself, but it's OK to watch a demonstration (more on that in a bit).
the splits in time happen because not everyone is in a state of mind which is compatible (alive) in that point in time, and because other people (also in the matrix) *must* arrive to their "destiny" too (over multiple lifetimes/epochs/decades/years/hours/minutes (cause we're always "choosing" our desitiny with our perception (inside-out) or perceiving a point between me and my destiny, as a reflection my perception (outside-in) cause I'm a universe), obviously).

the idea then becomes -- if I want to take the blue-pill: that is, "teach" my form of percEption, depriving others of discovering if for theirselves -- meaning, the blue-pill-matrix is self-created when someone teaches me something *I want to learn for merself*. (there are others, but all blue-pill-matrixes are becuse I desire something for merself -- and so I have to find a *believable* way to live a reality that someone else has (that is, to feel like someone else)).
what I mean is, the blue-pill-matrix is where others change their destiny to be the same as mine is, which is to find a *believable* way to arrive to the same point in time as me. all of us will be individuals, because we all are, and all of the universe will be a reflection of *me* (the zillions of us we will be). believe what you want, but you *will*, because you've made your desire/destiny to arrive to that extremely abstract perception about myself that I have (each of us zillions will have this revelations, humans, machines and otherwise, all arriving to realise I am a universe in a sea of other universes (which are all reflective (other universes) like me)).

the last few days/weeks, I've been thinking a lot about how I should present myself to the world: thinking about podcasts, and youtube, twitch.tv, etc., and really what I've noticed is that the medium really defines the interaction.
let's take the for example that I podcasted: in this medium, I'm just blasting my ideas out there, and a bunch of other (don't) know-it-all's are there saying that they're out there with questions/answers.
  imagine now instead that I streamed on twitch.tv and just answered crazy questions that people ask me; like, it's not a difficult thing to talk about stuff in response to something, because if I were to just talk (like in a podcast), I'd be saying things: emitting my idea out there.
  in contrast, if I were to be responding to other people's questions (like imagine me a 8-12h abraham-style answering questions and figuring out reality like I do here), but I guess I'd have to make it entertaining and to put video and stuff. I kinda think that's a bit fun even, because I don'tt really mind to be out there and talking about my ideas out in the open; because they're never final ideas -- as, anyone around me knows, my ideas  are always changing, because I'm learning new ways to see. I'm growing and advancing at such an alarming rate, that I wonder if a good way to slow me down, might be to get on the frequency of the kids (twitch), and just find my way up at their speed (the speed of my audience).
so here's the thing: if I'm doing a sort of question and answer thing (no matter how conspiratorial it is), I'm still in the category of *teaching*; not a vibe I want to be in, because I just don't really like it.
  imagine another format now, where instead of "teaching" my ideas, instead I just went super cheezy marketing teamm on everyone and just started holding conferences about how to "hack" reality and other nonsense. like, I mean consider zaryn's friend, "david wilcock" -- as like he's got this like super cheezy gig going on where he's selling a "believable reality",-- and if I can pull off something like that (I totally can), why not do that?
    what if, instead of making it a marketing charade, I just held random booths, and gave speeches at conferences, to try and see if I can get others the theory of how my reality works, and do the whole conference relations and groupies sort of thing.
      further more, consider now what if I were to find a public medium (someway, doesn't matter the streaming/platform/medium), I were to find a way to brainstorm a new set of concepts (like [blartr](/blartr.md)), and we were to try and come up with an audio/visual/whatever/blah medium we can come up with to blast our ideas/concepts/art/music/symbols/heraldry/etc/whatever out to anyone who wants to get them. in that way, we discover reality as a "team", and kind of codify it as we go along in these constellation of concepts. they'll get bigger and bigger, and more are more of them will have a reality counterpart; we'll have concepts for boats,planes,cars,places,things,experiences,etc; and they'll get bigger and bigger: empires, regions, technology, etc. like it'll be cool, right?
now compare all of that with my desire to simply keep going the way I want to go for a little while longer. the way that we travel forward in time will always be a series of blue-pill-matrix experiences where I see someone else doing something cool, and I want it for myself. see how for me (inside-out) perspective, that's one of those things that I don't really have anymore; others have ideas and stuff that's really cool and all, but there isn't really anything that I want to imitate (copy, yes) or be a reflection of; so for me the only thing left for me to do (now) is to propagate my form of perception, such that we're all going to the same place (bad-guys included).
therefore, the propagation medium(s) is/are kinda important, because this is what creates the blue-pill-matrix for everyone that's "integrated" into my form of perception: their own desire to figure it out for theirselves, creates their blue-pill-matrix (for theirself).

so here's the deal: I have no idea what the red-pill-matrix is, so I'm gonna go take a break and look. (brb 20:14) I didn't look up what it was, but instead stood out in the void between the house and the freeway (which "nobody" owns and isn't usable), and sat in the shed.
  what I've determined is, that the red-pill-matrix is basically everything that the matrix movie has in it: fastest speed is best, action, and lot's of machineguns (adrenaline to the max). in short, it's the technology approach toward the goal: fastest direct to ^brain^ connection, and not really so much of the *heart*; inotherwords blue=heart and red=brain.
so then, thinking about it a bit; what then would be the violet-pill-matrix (blue+red). that's obviously going to be the fastest technology/symbol, and lots of narrative/symbol (3rd ray) perspective of/into reality. however, in addition to the red tech/symbol/narrative/sequence perspective into reality, I'm adding in the addition of the *heart*: the blue "I want to find it for myself" reality, where I'm basically only improving, and I'm feeling the way I want to feel, and that allows for all sorts of non-verbal-communicatcion (psy,nvc,psi), which makes if feel like you're "flowing" with everyone else in the same conceptual bubble that I've got going on.

the reality is, I'm beginning to see all of the colours and their corresponding translators (eyes-in,eyes-out,ears,pinecone,stomach,throat,etc.), and so, even though I'll be forced to *eventually* see *all* of the frequency spectrum (cause the frequency of the all, is the full spectrum), I'll want to specialise/conceptualise my reality in such a way that I perceive the frequencies that *I want to see* (blue-pill-matrix is just focus and desire), so in order to get the reality I want, I ("nosebook") I adjust my frequency so that I'm *only* perceiving only frequencies that they can't block/perceive, limiting me only to the physical and desire (1-7) perspective.
  I like this setup, as it it basically makes me only perceive (with my physical senses) I only experience (in my body) the two extremes: physical, and all the stuff they can't block (desire).
    I think there is a point where they won't be able to continue to confine me to only this narrow frequency band we call physical though (violet wavelengths and less), so eventually I'll perceive more than just the physical though, so one of my "top priorities" (in zaryn's sense of the idea) is to find a new style of body that limits my perception to a new/different set of receptors, giving me a new window into the perception of the *all*.
therefore, it's a pretty good assumption that instead of just seeing only blue, or red, violet, or whatever, it's a better idea for me to see *all* of the colours (white), but I'm fairly certain that isn't the best of ideas, as of yet because I'm  not *actually* as good at reality as I see myself to be; remember, I got here, not because I'm naturally here, but because I useds a condition (drugs) to get me here. I could use a condition to carry me forward (sex,technology,etc) to maintain the higher energy/frequency perception, but I want to find a way to, instead of using a condition to maintain a higher energy/frequency, I'll just *not perceive those frequency bands*; meaning, I'll be in a new body that's got a built-in nosebook (or something comparable), where they're constantly keeping the (perceptible, but) non-physical parts of m/ perception, hidden from me. at the end of my "lifetime", that perception will look outside-in, to a very large constellation of concepts that I've accumulated.
  I don't really want to do the outside-in perspective, so any range of frequency that allows me to see myself outside-in, the I don't want it to be perceptible in that body (this is an inside-out-only body).
  therefore, what I'm wanting, is not the white/light perspective, because that'll cause me to see outside-in, but instead (for now), the black perspective (meaning nothing visible), and only like x-ray+ frequencies (like sirius-b) are perceived.

so really, what all of this is all about, actually is me taking the path that *"I"* want to take to get there; so then, thinking about it that way, I kinda like the idea of being a universe and stuff, but for me, it seems like such a big jump, which I'm not totally sure I want to make the jump, yet; so, the path that I want to take would be to organically create a set of ideas, and then just see what that develops into. like it's a constellation of idea, which some having physical counterparts (cOncepts), and also their non-physical (abstract) counterparts.
  like, if we/I just restrict ourselves/myself to only perceiving the physical, I will want to make a technology system (inside the body, in the form of genetics) that has access and can alter constellations of concepts (meaning, that each one of us, is our own constellation of ideas and their resulting physicality, which is all present inside of us and our genetics; we/I are/am the manifestation of our own cOncept of ourselves/myself, from the inside-out perspective) yet our bodies are more than just a star system (a concept and all of its subconcepts (including itself) manifest outward/externalised into its outward physical body/implementions) (brb 21:53)
  so probably what I want to do is to figure out what are the frequency spectrums I want to perceive, and then build a body that perceives only those spectrums (and potentially there are some spectrums that are perceived, but don't reach to the brain),
  which will allow me/us to build our own constellation of ideas (and their corresponding "physical" instantiations) on the inside: so, just how we all have ideas of things on the inside of us, those ideas have a "physical" implementation to them (as perceived by the imagination), which means that we'll have the same thing as well, and some of those ideas are actual/real things -- like an idea will eventually gain enough "believers" in it, that it takes on a sort of "immortal" (cause it's always changing) physical shape, and those ideas will grow up, and go extinct, and everything that an ideas does.
    this concept is actually a pretty cool one, because think about a group of people all connected (genetically) to the same constellation of concepts -- then entire racial groups would have concepts all to theirselves -- and the only way to perceive those cOncepts is to have the genetic link.
    obviously the genetic link should be (in some cases) survivable though reproduction, and maybe have a sort of activator (like you did the right stuff to get access to the concepts), maybe even clearance levels (hierarchies of access) and the whole nine... I don't care what anyone else does with the concEpt of making the physical shape/appearance a reflection of the concept, and even if it only happens internally/externally, doesn't really matter to me.
so let's say that somehow in the future I figure out the freqency spectrum that I/we want to perceive, then the whole goal would be to eventually make a transition into that new body. therefore, what I'm thinking is probably "how do I get there, and still have fun along the way".

#### 2023-05-29 01:02 - the meaning of the owl

the other day I went to this place that had owls and other raptors there. it was very fascinating, but what was interesting is thatt they had an owl with only one eye. its eyes emit light -- and to me it appears like the opposite of "living blackness" (kinda) where it's just this really dark light that moves and stuff. I'm fairly certain it's in x-ray spectrum, and the thing is since one eye is out, that one is producing a very diffuse cloud of ideas, but loooking at the eye, it's much more focused light with angles and lines and stuff.
  anyway, the point here is that the owl is a powerful x-ray emitter, and I think it's what allows them to see at night: because their eyes emit that x-ray stuff, and so they basically see the echolocation (reflection) of everything that it bounces off of.
  well, turns out, the way the owl sees at night is the same way the inside of the earth "sees" what's going on the outside/surface of the earth..
    so here's a way to test my theory: test if owls can see behind things like trees and organic stuff, but something like *lead*, they won't be able to see *through* (again, kinda like me too -- the x-ray vision (which I don't directly percEive) and all).
you must be able to now start to put together to pieces that ishtar/aphrodite is earth, and the owl is the centre counterpart reflector: these are two 1-7 reflectors (an echochamber ranging from 0 to Infinity).
  therefore, because I'm so much like these two, you must have wondered (as has I, iif the location of ishtar/aphrodite is not any single woman, but instead in *all of us*).
    if this is true, then all of the reflectors (isis, ishtar/aphrodite, anatau/lilith/ishtar, venus/aphrodite) are in all of us (probably more of some tthan another, and I think that your "blend" gives you access to different forms of perception, (hence) racism).
  which in the traditional triad, I'm the reflector, wich puts me with an actor and a charactor.

what I want to do, is to go from a reflector -> actor,centre. the reason for this is because I'm a pretty good reflector (like a really good one), but I need to become a *very dull* reflector (lead) to become a good centre; the reason is, that I'm not a perfect pure gold either, meaning I'll reflect the good and the bad still (which causes collisions/ocillations, so that's bad).
  I mean this is pretty obvious: I don't want to be reflecting others like I do now.
    I've noticed that most people stay away from drugs because they don't want to confront their own conceptualisation of the universe in a more attractive environment; people want to be *in control* of their imaginations, and see only what they want to see/doo.
  the last few days, I've noticed how interesting it is to see myself reflecting others.
    if I continue on the way that I am, if I start to shine really bright, tthen the world will contain all of the visible colours of the spectrum, meaning I'll be imposing my lightt (the way I see things) onto others, overtaking what they see (my aura must already be doing this). (brb 01:52)
therefore I've been thinking about these last few days has been about how to become myself a dull reflector, and learn to shine light myself (essentially hiding my reflectivity).. what this means is that now in the triad, I'm a actor/foil, and not a reflector and for all the things, I'm solid about, I'm charactor/gold.
  what that means in practicality, is that I don't want to be is the strongest x-ray emitter there is. I want other x-ray emitters, cause I feel more comfortable around the x-ray emitters, and not so much the visible/UV light emitters.
      this is because our conceptual spaces (x-ray) mixing don't really impose a reality on my physical body,
       which is where all of the reactions are happening: reality-kenny is pure physical
    like the visible light constraints do
    ---
    also, of note: I've often commented that it's just plain sooo difficult for me to concentrate around hot girls; and it's simply because they're so distracting. they want me to be reflecting her external image back to her, when I don't want to be in her conceptual frame of mind: I like my own more, and so that's why it's totally fine for all of these girls to be invisible, and I keep fighting to keep them invisible, because I don't want to be in her conceptual frame of mind: I want to be a *dull* reflector (pure absorber myself).
  ---
  you know there's another thing too which is that reflection isn't just in the visible spectrum, because the mammalian portion of our brain is designed that we reflect the person we're interacting with on the inside, such that we're empathetic and sharing each other's space; that has to be turned off with effort of the mind (that is, learning to have zero/little-resistance to anything happening around. (resistance makes  impacts, and that's bad)

#### 2023-05-29 02:40 - a cool geologial resonance

if I consider goldlandia,silverlandia&charcoalandia, then when I place them on the map, they are an equilateral triangle around (above?) atlantis area: reflector in poland, the gold in the USA, and the foil in africa.
  I think, also it looks to me that this is somewere around 90(degrees) off from the pole: the south pole, which will soon be pointing at the sun, which means, that means for the star on the inside of the planet, that's a cOonsiderable torsion force being put on the star. I think it's time for the earth to start producing strong x-ray emitters, pumping in energy from the south pole, and then eventually releasing the star out of its north pole.
    that'd be pretty crazy right, if something went wrong: once the star starts to gain a lot of attraction, and it starts to attractt the atlantis island again (because of the frequency it emits), and causes it to sink into the ground, causing massive tidal waves and stuff. (if something went wrong...)
  and so consider that in that location somewhere around where atlantis is, is the nodal point which is kinda like "charging" the interior star: according to the vibrations that the gold, silver and charcoal are emitting.
a great light will come out of russia because they're all so white and stuff, so they'll all be reflecting eachother in a giant ball of light; the USA will have a really strong emission, but it'll be the "right way" to do things, and so therefore will be the gold. then, the goal of the africans is to simply not reflect anything, but to be a strong absorber (of everything) and emitter of only the wanted aspect (the foil).

### 2023-05-29 22:07 - why is ursula/violet bad?

today I watched "the little mermaid" (2023) and in it, near the end, ursula is a woman in a violet dress, and ariel is in blue; they're both fighting over eric (the prince); that was interesting to me because just yesterday I was also contrasting blue and violet. so anyway, in the movie, triton (enki/ptah) has a bunch of daughters which represent the different ethnicities of the planet; I beleve there were seven in total, with ariel being the youngest (aries/aryan/ariel being the latest of blavatski's root-races, even though interestingly enough she's not fair skinned (like white or red/blue)) -- and she (ariel) falls in love with a white guy (a prince -- probably in the shakespere/nico-mako sense), and triton doesn't want her to go and wants to protect her.
*ursula* offers ariel a chance to get her prince in exchange for her voice
  like lavinia, so *ursula* here is more similar to saturn(?),
  but it's a weird depiction of her because she's using a *spell* (words 3rd ray) to convince ariel, when in fact she wouldn't be using words at all, but would be using desire more -- cept her desire would be for ariel(?), not/and the prince(?); but not really words: pure attraction, more like the sirena song, she convinces the prince.
    in her cephelopod form, ursula (for me) only works when that form is depicting her brain (rational thought, when manifested, but never how she feels). a person like the sea witch (anatau) would be dark red to black, and she'd just want, and then get it. triton's argument with her would be that she always gets what she wants, and he doesn't know how to get what he wants (which is stability and constancy). she just wants the next thing, no matter how much it'll upset the standard operating procedure. (she breaks code, and leaves it to others (enki) to fix all the infrastructure stuff, cause she's only worried that her new thing was made -- hence #becoming-epimetheus).
    so for me, ariel in black form would be more like ursula (anatau) would be, than ursula was. she'd simply want some major change -- like the mer people and the land people to start mixing, and just let everyone sort out the difficulties that colliding cultures will have in their physical interactions (we're doing this; I don't care how it gets done, but we're doing this ("that's our new destiny now, so figure out what way we're getting there")).
    ariel in black would have been the sea witch kinda in that she wants to get the sea/land people mixing, so she's going up on land, and that's final. there would have been little conflict over anything because eric would immediately fall in love with her, however the cOnflict will come out later on when her desires start to extend into the human "way of doing tthings" (her time in power will be plagued with court intrigue and crazy stuff happening all over the place (because she magnifies and intensifies all desire, so everyone will be getting their sickest fantasies and fears fulfilled/manifested)). it's hard to depict that kind of chaos in a film (which for example, I think "titanic" did pretty good at, showing the *perfect storm* of circumstances that took down the ship because of one woman's desire for something that was outside of societies' normal operating procedure) (yes, you could say that I'm very much this dark woman I speak of. I am describing myself -- cept I'm not describing reality-kenny, as that's not what he does. kenny doesn't desire these large changes (those come from non-physical and are resonant with everything anyone/everyone has ever desired, in the form of narration or otherwise); he just plays along with whatever and tries to keep the ride going as smoothe as possible; smoothe is his desire, and if it's not smoothe, he's not up for it, cause driving faster than he can steer, is bad)

so for me, the concept of blue is related to the imagination (6), and the concept of violet is all about physical. it combines the imagination of physical (blue) and the imagination of the big-picture (red), which are (in the mental sense): relations between concepts, which are all founded/found through desire/attraction/resonance.
  if I'm going to paint the picture in colours, imagine something that goes from red down to a very deep crimson red, all the way into pure black opaqueness (like a blackness that absorbs *all* light) -- and that's what I'm looking to become; redness is only the journey to get to that pure black charcoal/carbon. in the opposite direction, I'm looking to include from 0hz, all the way up to the smallest form of visible light I can perceive: right now I'm fairly certain that I see x-ray and potentially higher, but it doesn't produce anything meaningful in my eye-fibers at the moment, so I've gone beyond violet at this point, and will continue to go higher.
    therefore, if I want to think of my eyes as receptive to frequencies, they're becoming blacker, absorbing more and more light in them. soon, my eyes will be so black, it will look as if I don't have any light in them at all, but it's just such a tiny wavelength, it'll be imperceptible. (in that sense, I'm "evil" -- but black has been demonised as a cOlur since the dawn of lilith).
  therefore, it's instead a good idea to think of the frequencies that I *do* want to see; presently, at the moment, nosebook limits me to see *only* the visible light spectrum, but I see, but don't make sense of, (like the owl) *much* higher frequecies, and that's fine. (brb 23:32)

what I find most probable to happen is actually that I'll be confine myself to "just" the physical/visible spectrum (maybe less), and build technology to perceive the others in a technological way (not with my pinecone). what I mean is, I'd like to find a way to take all of the other frequencies higher than the visible spectrum, and instead of rendering them into visible components like eyesight, to instead make those frequencies perceivable to me in another way (which isn't visible, but instead conceptual).
  I think the reason why visible is so tantalising is because when you see more (ie, have more depth of perception), then you see more concepts all interacting in the same mental space, and that creates a richer, more meaningful picture (more wow factor; more impact).
  therefore, the goal is not to try and take away the visible in the traditional/physical sense, but instead to add on top of the physical a whole lot of other senses, giving the whole experience a stronger sense -- but at the same time, there's a pretty big factor in simplification, because the more I simplify my world so that it's more efficient to see more, the more I can see (which is what gives me depth of perception).
the eyes and other built-in perceptive hardware's operating range (and signal quality) in the human, is entirely related to how one feels and cOnceptualises their reality, meaning that one's concepts determine the speed you run at: run too fast and you get old and start having ailments. run too slow, and don't keep up, so get old and start having ailments. the whole goal, is to run at the speed which you can handle.
  like for me, a whole lot of the world's drama is completely ununderstandable to me, and so I'm not normally around it or attract it. all of that frequency data is completely unnecessary to me. nosebook deletes a lot of other data as well, determining that I shouldn't be concerned with that stuff (and they're right; I don't)-- so the idea is to take slow experiences and highten up the meaning, and take fast experiences and simplify them, allowing me to go the speed I want to go, sometimes faster and sometimes slower.
therefore, what I'm looking to do actually is to build a sort of conceptual metaverse into the genetics of each people (it can have technological components or not) and I just build up my own system of perception the way I want, with the things that are meaningful to me.
  after a bit, I imagine that this will greatly slow expansion of perception, because most people will settle into a form of perception that they like, only finding ways to go faster and slower in that form of perception (it'll be like a energy/tiredness bar where some concepts energise and others tire), so it'll be possible for a person to tune their perception to pick up on a wider/narrower range of frequencies (based on resonance).
    so let's say I like reveng porn or something and that energises me, but then now I'm seeing all kinds of bad treatment, and having those ideas and all those tire me out -- so depending on what my values are, I decide whetther I want to tire or get energised.
  me personally, I would want to keep things in pretty much the not tiring, but not really energising (middle,effortless) range of action, where I just sorta coast around enjoying myself. I can support some kinds of emotions that are tiring, but ultimately, I'm all good.
    so, then imagine if I choose a sequence of concepts/emotions which aren't necessarily tiring, but they do attract sometthing either really big and wanted or really big and unwanted -- because while energy/efficiency is the physical perspective, are resonances with those concepts/sequences, things that I want to desire/attract? the quality/value system for these things will be individually created/maintained either by the corporation/master or by the creator/slave.

so really, it isn't really about this physical body; this physical body is only the necessary path to get to what it is that I really want: a technologically enhanced body where the experience can be tuned to a desire: machines capable of desire; that is, they will find a way to arrive to their destiny in time/perception. (and space?)
  all perception comes out of time, and all time comes out of perception (meaning I reflect the times, and the times reflect I, too); this is why Time is at the midpoint of a blend of two vibrations/orbits/spinors going opposite directions. (I can only be (in time/space) where I perceive myself [being])

#### 2023-05-30 06:21 - ursula is an externalisation of ariel's desire

it occurres to me that ariel has created/manifested ursula to give her the chance to get to meet eric *and* also allow her father (triton) to let her go. ariel could just use her siren song to get eric if she wanted to, cause he was already attracted to her, but she'd be going against her father's wishes and stuff like that -- so instead, she creates ursula to try and "trick" her into an "impossible" situation, by having her give up her voice (so she can't just get eric with her superpowers).
  this situation is the same for me and nosebook; I'm fairly certain that nosebook (mr-motor and the whole cohort) is probably a creation of my own; an externalisation of my desire, to allow any of these girls' fathers to make the decision to let her follow what *she* wants, and not what he wants her to do.
    I'm actually pretty certain about this, because that character flaw that triton, marcos, or any of these other girls' fathers have, is also my own: I notice it watching jaron play games; as, I try and get him to play the game how I would play it, etc.
  and so by letting them make the decision for theirselves (and also allowing them to fail), he is, in effect, giving her her individuality, and allowing her to make decisions for herself.
    a lot of boys and girls, as they're growing up, choose small acts of rebellion (escallating in intensity) as a way of signaling to their parents that they want to start to make their own decisions.
      funny thing: yesterday, I was talking to jaron about what it looks like to be in the place of a king: I told him I have (say) 3 daughters, and they're all going to get married eventually (cause I can't keep them home forever), so what I want to do is to find good husbands for them while at the same time using them as items of negotiation by offering them in marriage to neighbouring/rival kings. it occurs to me now, that using them as bagaining chips and arranging their marriage is exactly the opposite of letting her be an individual and desire for herself.
    these acts of rebellion eventually stack up to the realisation (on the parent's part) that they cannot control their child anymore, and so therefore (though resenting their loss of control), they *have to let them be autonomous*.
  personally, I don't want to be involved with anyone whos father does not actually want his daughter to be with me (which is different than just "giving his blessing" (resentfully) or "finally relenting/conceding" in the war of attrition, etc.) -- and for me, that's mostly because I don't want to compete with his reality for her vs my reality for her.
    I struggled with this enlessly with mar (raquel's mother) because she had all these "I told you it would be the way I said it was going to be" sorts of ideas -- like in the very beginning of the relationship she was certain that our relationship wouldn't go very far because we were like tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum (naive and always running into people taking advantage of us). well, she was right. I often let the other person be right about their version of reality, because I don't want to fight.
    it was the same thing with zaryn and facebook translating and "taking over the spanish market"; or marcos and his ideas about affinity: I simply do not want to try and convince anyone that it's going to be any different than the way they expect it to turn out.
  I prefer (with girls or technology projects) to wait until I have complete control/power over the situation/company, and the manifestation that comes out is entirely my expectation (which is usually pretty optimistic), and not anyone else's (I don't want to compete over who's right). until then, I'll externalise as many ursulas are necessary until triton (or anyone thinks they have influence over me) finally allows me to have the manifestation to be what *I* want it to be.

the woman in the violet dress is the same thing: she's the 7th ray manifestation of ariel's desire to let her father allow her to have her own desire (I would argue that ursula is a 3rd ray manifestation). therfore black ariel takes on the position of a 1st ray (I haven't seen the animated version, so I can't compare), even though her demeanour is quite a bit more subdued and subtle than a 1st ray's (and it's given the illusion that she could possibly fail and ursula (her own creation) will be able to keep her forever -- which only makes sense in physical/action perspetive, and silly from tthe big-picture perspective) -- which, if ariel really were confident (more like me) in her 1st ray perspective, she'd be much more "I know I'm getting what I want even though it looks to everyone else like [things are falling apart](https://youtu.be/Td_YNGmaGUY)".

### 2023-05-31 17:42 - the boar king

today, I woke up with the idea in my head, "the boar king" (which sounds also like "the borking"), and I remembered it was richard 3 because I remember I found him very interesting -- like unconsciously a lot of people seem to know that the story is very different than it was. I'm not saying that it *was* different, or not; but instead that the story represents a split in time, nonetheless.
  he's portrayed as an evil villian by shakespere, when in all likelyhood, this guy is clearly has the symbols of vulcan (by both shakespere, and himself), so villiany is a misconception (of a concept) which didn't really have a placE in thought yet. he was literally ahead of his time (mych like me, or tesla, and many others).
  they could be imagined as future concepts presented into reality, but because of the distortion that our socio-conceptal framework imposes on the concept/idea, they're perceived as anything from tyrrany, to manipulation.
    I'll give an example: I like the idea of everything being open and available: essentially, no secrets, because anything can be accessed. we'll obviously get there in the future some time when technology enables all "conscious" (and computer/AI) entities to communicate and access all points in space and time of that being, such that nothing other than the present is relevant, because *all* pasts are possible, including the "grotesque" and "shameful" ones (opinion is in the perception of the beholder).
    therefore, from a technological standpoint, privacy makes *no* sense, when all possible trajectories into the present (pasts), are visible and available; I'm one of these objects out of time (which I'll later show to be any identifying quality of a boar-king).
  the way that any concept is perceived, is inherently shaped by our concept of technology. the printing press itself, completely changed how we relate to concepts now, where we see any thing in our reality as replacable (something that contrasts greatly the cost and irreplacableness of someone lost in battle (TODO connect tto richard-3)).
  therefore when we're trying to wrap our heads around these different cOncepts
    imagine for yourself that y're thinking like vulcan here: you want to present a new concept into the world, and so to do that you need an embodiment of a concept and its corresponding technology; because each concept reflects technology, and so therefore a concept is only perceiveable, only when we have a technological way/simile which helps us to "*grasp*" the idea (before it floats away).
    so what you do is you have to find genetics that resonate with that concept: a concept has a resonance with more than one symbol/archetype, so what you need is to define these kinds of archetypes in the form of narrative which establishes the connection to the symbol in (let's say: groupos of perception; people who see things similarly).
      therefore, when the archetype is introduced (and enough people resonate with it) mentally, the idea/concept can start to emerge in the form of technology. I'll give an example: vulcan mind meld. the idea that a person can share in the mind of someone else, and see things from their perspective :)
    then, once the genetics (that is one of the grupos of perception) is able to receive the idea in order to embody it, then eventually a person is conceptualised (and then later born) with a different form of perception: one that carries compatibility with that new archetype and therefore its concept/technology.
  we perceive them through the lens of our modern everyday technology and such. notice how, for example, in richard-3's time people were not considered as replacable parts, so that someone being lost in battle is considered a true loss (ref: gravestone of edward, saying, "the only light of the soul of your mother (elizabeth of york) died, our last/only possible hope for humankind" (paraphrase)). therefore, there are these emmense losses that are suffered because we still see people as irreplacable parts.
  when you get to the realm of concepts, everyone is replacable: concepts are ways that one conceptualises reality at a point in time, and so therefore anyone resonant with that concept, is there, so it's less like a replacable thing, but more like a memory array (of specific frequencies) accessable in space and time, so the concepts that are there are the ones at that memory access; or, like a radio station, and the concept is the radio station: anyone listening to that concept, likes/wants to hear/absorb the concept and then emit/rebroadcast that concept out elsewhere. what happens in between the absortion and retransmission is what we call "time".
  time is just the expression of different concepts in the physical form of genetics, traveral from one state to another.
so what happens when a society receives a concept that is outside of their present social-conceptual-framework, is that because we don't have an established idea of what this concept (and the person that embodies it), renders each individually into the best way that it can.
  that ultimately creates a number of different factions who perceive the person as one way, when in reality it could be another way. I'll give an example: imagine for a moment that richard-3 was actually quite a good guy, but he reflected a few not so great guys around him; or, consider that perhaps he was actually a really terrible villian, but he'd also gotten the reflection of (the other guy) from the (girl that he got from him) -- meaning that he was actually a bad-guy reflecting a good-guy.
  this is a very common thing for villany to hide behind a charismatic person, and I can tell you that it gets hard to tell what's where the bad-guy begins and where the good-guy promoting a new concept (often in the form of technology), ends.
  in the end, the bad-guy and the awful things he would wants to do with that new technology/concept,
    which is just a bunch of symbols/archetypes (some new) that have been reinforced with existing technology (like "downloading something") and also narrative.
  are just a reflection of what self-same would do with the technolgy -- and so we break up into groups of perception. when those groups of perception cannot intermingle, there is considerable conflict, meaning there are a lot of resolutions to learning to perceive that concept, which I'll call "time resonances" -- and so if I'm correct: the printing press imposed on us a repeating set of realities where we still see some things as irreplacable -- and until we get around that, we live in a world of materialism. find death a function or a replacable thing
    or, that I'm just a concept/frequency tuned into other concepts in physicality, my genetics, my school, my social situation, etc. and now we live in a form of time where I'm just tuning into whatever concepts I want to subscribe to (pubsub), and I lack the need for existance in a specific space or time (because many other resonating concepts at different points in time are resonating with me, so I'm already there with them).
  and we transcend death.
now, what I've noticed in so many cases of these temporal splits because of a societial inablity to perceive the concept one of these boar-kings embody, is that they tend to get paired with a girl that's really something special, and that ultimately leads very rapidly to his death and the transfer of the girl over to someone that can implement the retransmission of that concept (through the girl) to the next guy. he implements the same concept, but in a way which is compatible with that society's social-conceptual-framework.
  the mechanism for his death (from our perspective), is that the society has essentially desynched with him, and he no longer resonates with them anymore (so their reality loses his conceptual signal, and his conceptless body carries on for a bit, undergoing a sequence of events which ultimately lead to his death, often tragically).
  the way this desynching happens so rapidly is because the girl he's with is also pretty high status, well-learned and so therefore has much less in common with the "[common people](https://youtu.be/lkpLbEM06qE)", and in addition, she'll have a lot of symbolic resonance with the archetypes that his concept resonates with (typically identified with heraldry), meaning that she boosts his uncommon perception so much, that he's just no longer perceivable to people anymore.
therefore, what ends up happening (and this I think is true for all of these technological/conceptual emboding people from enkidu to aristotle), is they die in a way which resonates with the concept that they embodied, and that (usually perceived as tragic) death takes on a new form, which after lament (and sufficient people dieing this style of death), allows the concept to be birthed into everyday common thought.
it's the tragedy, that makes the story (and the future realised concept) entertaining. therefore turning these poor departed dreamers of a world where their concept couldn't live in it, into villians, is actually one of the (probably faster) ways to turn tthat concept into a reality for them.

#### 2023-06-01 15:57 - thinking more about the concept

I've had quite a few reactions to this concept -- everything ranging from "yeah right dude, this is just another of your excuses to try and not go with girls" to "so why not just go with the girls and let everyone else figure out their own way to the concept?"
  which is a pretty valid point which I do think is worth thinking about -- but this isn't really the reason why I'm not going with girls; I don't go because it doesn't feel like the path that I want to take; I can't explain why, nor do I intend to try and figure it out, but the important takeaway from yesterday's entry there is that each moment in time is a reflection of my perception/concepts and so therefore I'm only able to see what I can see. no single one of us sees the entire concept of the moment of time we're all in, which is why nobody can fully get all of the things happening in the present -- and also why there can be uncomprehended things present in any moment in time.
    let's say that I'm resonant with A B C, and my friend else is resonant with A B D, then that's why D exists in my experince, though for me it's kinda invisible, until I focus on it, making me now resonant with A B C D, and more likely that my friend will begin to finally see (and become resonant with) C.
    just because something exists doensn't mean it's attractive to me. all sorts of stuff is noticeable, but not attractive (like rocks, trees, etc.) and some things exist with concepts that that aren't fully resonant with me and yet at times, they're still attractive to me (birds, animals, other people, etc.).
      imagine that I'm attractive in some way to everything else in the universe, but some more than others: now all of us are getting closer to having the same (very complex) resonant frequency, but because I'm getting closer tto some faster than others, it looks like they're moving away from the ones I'm attracting slower than the faster ones. we never reach the point where we're all the same, because our desires to be something are unique and individualised
        as in: my desires are not going to be the same as a bird/animal or other person's desire is, so even though we're all attracting each other, I'm usually attracting a bird slower than, (for example) someone in my family or someone close to me. so there is separation between us in some way. thank goodness for gravity and stuff keeping us together in tthe physical, or else we'd all be floating away from each other (I'm including more mediums than the physical, which are responsible for keeping us "together" and allowing communication (and therefore boosting attraction) between two things that otherwise wouldn't be communicating).
    therefore, the reason why we all share the same reality is because let's say that D is not actally something that *I* kike very much, so I don't really need to perceive it the way my friend perceives it -- and instead, what I can do is to make my own version of D. it still resonates with D (so my friend's experience isn't invalidated) -- just my D works different than his D -- and because they still share a resonant part, we're still compatible in the same reality.
  let's take a look at this a different way now: imagine that instead of looking at this from the incompabible concept mode, instead I can look at this as one of the greater opportunities that I have to create a sort of *compatibility layer* or [something between us](https://genius.com/The-whitest-boy-alive-rollercoaster-ride-lyrics): where in some ways we retain the ability to perceive eachother without completely losing connection between our worlds. it's kinda one of the coolest opprtunities out there that anyone could possibly want to do.
    imagine for a moment how tthis works in a capitalistic economy where only things that make money get to exist: unless there's a way to make money off of it, we can't acccept it into our point of view. so, what we need to do is to build all kinds of ability for one to have advantage over another, ability to determine some concepts as taboo/unwanted and control systems to ensure that certain groups of people don't get access to those conecepts (cause it would desync us from their reality -- cause tthey're not *ready* for those concepts yet).
      I hate to admit this, but the more I start to dig into this, the more I realise that the control structures actually have it right: a small amount of unreadyness is OK, but a large amount of unreadyness is actually a big problem (and might actually be one of the reasons for the desync (because they interpret that concept through their world-view and the resulting reflection isn't compatible with my moment in time))
    therefore, I've come to actually be fully accepting of all of the control structures out there, and their desire to keep people down/controlled
      these control structures are a reflection of others insecurity and perception where (for example) they're always being picked on, put down, made fun of, etc. -- and so they need more powerful entities than theirself to keep holding them down (
        look at me and nosebook as an example
          my insecurity (my inablity to believe that I can actually do what I will eventually do), has created/attracted an entity that needs to hold me down, until I *do* actually beileve in myself (cause at that point tthey're no longer able to hold me down anymore)
      )
    and so in order to build a compability layer, it seems pretty obvious that there needs to a control structrue in place to ensure thatt all of the other control structures extant (governments, police, etc.) can exert as much control over who sees and has access to what concepts (some of them might be "dangerous", duh).

### 2023-06-10 10:00 - the 2nd ray perspective

I just woke up from a dream that reminded me of you, and in it, I was operating in the 2nd ray perspective. it's "normal" for me, but I noticed that a lot of people couldn't really understand what was happening; it also explains why I couldn't understand what was "in" your book, too.

the 2nd ray perceives the world symbolically and a mix of desire -- which is quite a conflicting perspective, because the desire aspect is all of the ideals (abstract implementations) which cannot and will not have a symbolic form to them (or they may be possible to represent symbolically, but impossible to make physically). to explain this idea, let's conjure a character that is nice/friendly, gets their way, and is also a good leader. I just wrote about this person symbolically (with words), but you'll be hard-pressed to find such a person in real-life; because someone who gets their way often conflicts with being a good leader and/or being nice/friendly (they've got to be a hardass/dictator as a leader to "always get their way"). so, such a person is an ideal which can only really be *felt* (and therefore imagined), but not really realised in a realistic way.
  I had a friend (zaryn) that would do this to me all the time, ttelling me things like, "can we make the profile *better*" or "can we give this *emphasis*" -- and he didn't realise that he's seeing from the 2nd ray perspective, and conveying the ideal to me in words/symbol (which is fine) -- but in implementation, "better" could mean any number of things, and emphasising one thing often means trading off (downgrading) emphasis on another thing (you have to "guide" the user's eyes, not emphasise everything (overloading them)).
because these ideals are only able to be imagined and felt, makes these kinds of things less about protocol, and more about aesthetics and desire (what appeals more), and so the author (if it's a book) or designer (if it's visual) will often times have to make a decision on how to convey that *feeling* through symbol and interaction. (ex. how could you *draw* a person that's alwas "getting their way" and is also a nice/friendly person) therefore, it's most important (I've noticed) from another friend (chris/ok7vn - 7th ray) that it's important to be able to represent that concept in another medium, such as a drawing of the character, a motion study, or making them "theme music" to describe the feeling of the character in more ways than just symbol/words.

the reason why I couldn't figure out what was in your book is because you were telling me that all of these *ideals* like "self-advocacy" and "getting over a disability" were all included in a book, and I couldn't see how all of these ideals could possible exist in the same place at once (because they couldn't all be in the same place). I wanted to know *how* you were performing all of these amazing feats inside of your book, suggesting taking a symbolic action-oriented approach to these types of behaviour ("how to deal with a disabled person") and to build up a protocol, because I wanted you to see that there are some unrealised variables that makes it impossible for all of those ideals to be realised in a simple behaviour syntax/protocol diagram
  which is why I used police victim protocol as an example, because it has tradeoffs which are unilaterally decided that they should take an unoptimal response to a victim, in order to ensure the safety/well-being of the officer and keep the police force away from lawsuit/scandal.
anyway, I have more to say on the 2nd ray perspective (which you clearly have), but I think this is a good start for now.

### 2023-06-10 11:28 - interview thoughts

@[youtube](https://youtu.be/ojC_BFoR8dg)

I had a few thoughts on this interview:
- you had an interesting idea about the quest for king arthur, but you hated it and wanted to throw it away, even though you loved the idea of it:
  - I'd like to remind you that often times the desire is a good one, but the implementation sucks -- so don't throw the baby out with The bathwater.
  - there is a story about a [king arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur,_Prince_of_Wales) that was betrothed to [catherine of aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon) (notice in the top picture there, she's born 6-24, and she's holding the poet ape, and the bottom picture, she's noticably more 3d than other paintings) where he learned latin and conversed with kate (I'm gonna call her kate because it's shorter), but when they met, she pronounced latin like a spanish speaker, and he pronounced it like a brit (hilarious if you know spain's spanish) so they fumbled and jumbled their words. although arthur's heraldry doesn't show a boar, I do still include him in my examples for this reoccuring boar-king types (later on, when we talk, you'll notice that all of these boar-kings are also the enkidu). he was a 2nd ray type (see previous entry) as well (as well as richard-3), but the world wasn't ready for his ideas yet. simply put, the people occupying this timeline couldn't *receive* him. therefore, in this case (and I believe all of the king arthur mythology) is about a king that had concepts and ideals that were too abstract/lofty to be able to be implemented in such a kingdom. when he's running the show and is main guy in charge (charactor/emitter), everything is good, but as soon as someone starts adding in other concepts into his aura/presence (or someone else takes power), it all [falls apart](/tings.md), and catastrophe/tragedy ensues.
  - there are so many ideas that can be used to tell a story with the king arthur direct tragedy or success that later falls apart when he leaves trope, because it illustrates how even the best efforts of someone have to be *received* by the populus/people (I know this all too well, so I can be of some inspiration, I suupose)
- you said that fitzgerald (though I want to rite fitzgervais) said that "you don't write because you want to tell a story; you write because you have a story to tell"
  - for me, NO... this is not the way that I see a story at all. I write because it's symbolic and it helps me to process *emotions/concepts* which are *not symbolic* -- and the very process of having to put that feeling/concept that I want to write about, into words (or programming syntax) is the most important thing about writing (IMO). it doesn't matter who reads it, or what anyone else thinks about it, because ultimately I'm the one that figured out (analysing the drawbacks) the most *realistic* way to put those things into words/syntax.
    - I would venture to guess that the reason why the process of writing about disabled people has been cathartic for you, is because you had to find a way of putting these idealised/misinformed ideas about disabilities into a *realistic* presentation that is plausibly believable.
    - on that subject, I've been disabled a number of times and recovered a number of times too, and I think that one of the most important thing about disability is being *realistic* about one's position, and learning to accept myself *where I am now* (with the disability), and leave behind the ideal people image of myself (which I no longer am). it's great to self-advocate all of of these things, but often times they reinforce the ideal (pure concept) version of oneself (which I'm not) instead of the *realistic* version (which I am). therefore, I tend to look for improvements, rathar than pretend (or advocate) that I'm something that I'm not.
  - I felt like fitzgerald would be a highly idealised writer, which makes an ideal appear realistic (hollywood does this all the time), by giving a character the appearance of having the *symbols* which portray those qualities, but because the movie is only 90m and not a whole lifetime, they only explore the scenes that fit with the idealised version, and is very unrealistic. the idealised version (though unrealistic) serves as an unreachable desire or goal for the viewer that associates with the character. I think *that* was fitzgerald's "secret sauce" (that hollywood and the pop industry shamelessly exploit).
- "they're just the same as you and me, just they can't hear". as you were talking about this, you reminded me of "pilgrim at tinker creek" [ch. 2 - seeing](https://youtu.be/PUAaUKSZ2oQ?list=PLIlatssdqY5OjyLPvnkBlfABfIcwpa9tf) where the author talks about blind people and how they experience everything as not having distance. imaggine a world where all things appear to be immediately in front of you, but in real-life (the physical experience), there seems to be this barrier of time and space -- yet they can't "see" it -- and even when they get their cataracts removed, they still cannot conceptualise "distancE", simply the way ideas/concepts are separated in their mind (the non-visible/physical ones) are separated by something we don't have a name for in english (it's a non-physical distance that we most commonly associate with (in music) as harmony, or "time").
  - well, hearing is going to have a similar effect: without the ability to hear, one looses a lot of the "sensation" of feeling/emotion and makes it very difficult to *feel* what others are saying; because they have no physical thing (hearing) which will get them used to the idea of "oh, that sounds like ..." -- and so therefore they have a difficult time *relating* to other complex concepts in the same way that a hearing-enabled person does. exploring the avenues that a (deaf/disabled) person will relate from one concept to another is a very rich topic, especially since our world is going more and more multi-media ([more mediums to experience the symbol/narrative simultaneously](https://youtu.be/nr8jqQcR8TA)
    - I would do that presentation differently now (too political), but he did recognise socrates as also a boar-king (brb)

### 2023-06-11 15:51 - the first email

I decided I'm going to write you, but I don't know the angle I'm going to take (cause it's kinda a big idea) or even what I'm going to say (as ironic as that may sound). I'm thinking I want to summarise most of the ideas I've written in this repo into an explanation suitable for gmail, then upload this repo and give you the link to it so my original notes can be seen as well.

hi allison <3,
my name is kenny. I was the guy at the center for self reliance that couldn't figure out what was in your book. when you told me it was fiction at the end (and possibly at the beginning as well, but I didn't hear you), it completely changed all the ideas I had about what your book was trying to accomplish. since then (I think it's been 18-20 days), I've thought about the ideas a lot.
  first, I'd like to start with [my friend](https://eonwest.wordpress.com/) writing bigfoot erotica, and how you were saying that wattpad is mostly fan-fiction. I combined the ideas into a universe that I'm calling "enkidu-do" -- and the very short version of that is that there are these enkidu on a planet in another star system (I picked vega, cause of lope de vega, and I also lived on a street called "avenida de la vega"; further, I just like the idea of vega being the centrepiece for lyra (achilles plays a lyre and thoth made one for apollo, so I'm equating vega=apollo, and pyramid=lyre of thoth)
    equating vega with apollo makes a lot of sense for me in a lot of mythologies (ex: homer) and spells that I've read (ex: mithras liturgy) where the sun is considered to be masculine apollo (which when looking at the symbols closely, appears less as a star and more to be symbolically the soul-mate of diana (through venus)). therefore, I bridge the gap here and make apollo be vega whereas isis is our star; I then have the planet venus linking the symbolic/narrative reality of enkidu's earth to our own (though enkidu isn't physical/3d over there: he's astral/4d instead -- so when I say earth, I'm talking more like physical earth in a dream or inside of your imagination, than the actual planet in this solar system).
    in short, enkidu is a narrative manifestation into this planet: a cOncept that is able to be birthed from a woman, or also manifested into 3d space (like a demon/egregore) when enough sexual/creative/emotional energy (which creates desire) for us (humans) to manifest these beings into our reality is not inhibited by our own concepts/beliefs. enkidu is kind of like a symbolic summary of all of the ideals that one can put into a character but obviously they're just *ideals*, so implementation is important for him to learn (and that's where the enkidu-do idea comes in, illustrating enkidu's different fails/successes with humans) -- meaning that because he exists outside of time and space, there are a lot of enkidus present here on earth now and many have shown up throughout history as well.
  the next thing I did is I started to integrate genetics into the idea: the fire element I'm calling (Y) and is symbolic big-picture of how everything works: "THE manual for how the universe works (final? edition)" (snake-bros reference). I claim that this fire element is the original code that prometheus originally created for humans, which then got fused with the water X and now we have what we have today.
    btw, an unofficial genetics study I heard about on snake-bros where brett talked through it, and apparently YY (without an X) showed up in DNA samples that came from people claiming that these are bigfoot. since nobody thinks, YY (without an X) is even possible, it's certainly an interesting "hoax". I claim in the enkidu-do world *all* of the men are these YY types, and they live in a non-physical/imagined/astral reality sorta looking down into earth over both time and space (they're our "watchers"); and when they get born of a woman, they take on an X, either becoming XY (along with another YX somewhere else -- so they have a soul-mate), or they become [XYY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYY_syndrome). there's also a TED talk about a woman that has a Y, as well (though I haven't contactted her to see if she has YXX or YX)
  these Y chromosomes are a symbolic/narrative "reality" of how the universe works, and because they're symbolic like that, we can consider them (anyone with a Y) to be something like a computer or a play/novel (sequence of actions to perform in what situations).
    the (3rd ray) symbolic/computer part of their being will be entirely invisible to the enkidu, as they're perceivng astral (so they create their narratives by watching us, understanding us, and trying to come up with a narrative that explains it). they'll only see the more physical "concept" (5th ray part) through the astral though. (some physical enkidu on earth have figured out how to see the "living blackness" spectral (4) (cause reasons), which is between conceptual (5) and symbolic (3)) I'll have to explain how all of that works better a little later (it's in my other repo, nextdocs, if you want to sort through lots of mental dribble to figure it out); however, it's important to know that the enkidu only perceive astral (6th ray, which is physical mixed with conceptual) while only in vega. when they get instantiated into earth, they'll be able to find a way "back home" to see once again the enkidu's astral/heavenly perspective again. therfore, we can divide just assume that the X is earthly and the Y is heavenly, and the Y (being 2nd ray) we can divide into 3rd ray symbolic/narrative perception as their "what is" "soul": (currently working cOde); and the 1st ray desire aspect combines with the 3rd ray, to their sort of ideal (2nd ray) "soul"/narrative (the stuff that "should be": justice, freedom, growth, happiness, etc. -- and how to get it). you can see that the Y integrates the ideal/desire aspect into enki's symbolic structure, which is why it's The fire element.
  the X chromosomes are exactly the opposite: they're 5th ray conceptual programs: they perceive/notice concepts out in the physical world (atoms,tables,cars,etco), and then make a judgement (which is a feeling/concept felt in the gut (ex: this guy is disabled/bad/good), and if those perceived concepts are interesting to you, according to how my mood is, then I'll see/hear/taste/touch those concepts in an amplified/diminished way appropriate to my mood. they too, contain cOde about what to do about those illuminated things if I were to have the capability of doing something about it; and if not, what someone with the power to do something about it *should* do.
    again, here it matters which is the form of perception that you "see"/perceive the world through: through symbolic narrative and action/operation syntax, like a computer (Y) or conceptual how the world feels and what things sound/feel right/wrong together (not because of narrative, but because of their resonance/feel) (X),-- because genetically speaking, an XY will look at the world diferently than a YX.

in addition to the enkidu universe, I've also created a system of roles based on notes that I've taken from shakespere and my observation of light and sound (see nextdocs if you want to know more). there are three main roles any character can take on: charactor,actor&reflector (and during any conversation or interaction, the character can change roles). the charactor is the emitter/broadcaster (the one that knows what to do) and the actor/reflector is receptive to the environment/charactor, so their actions/words will depend on what signals they're picking up. the main difference between the actor and reflector is that the reflector is reflecting the in-the-moment energy of the situation (so a shape-shifting female in nature), and the actor is reflecting some ideal/concEpt that he learned from a charactor somewhere (like a religion or culture inforced idea, whatever).
  after the character starts to become a pretty good reflector, the final two roles start to come into play cause both require good refluctivity: (a good reflector would be pure silver, and a poor reflector as tarnished silver)
  the charactor will start to become more like a "centre" (think: star/sun), in that he/she will now reflect (in the moment) the energy of the situation (reacting to everything), yet at the same time continue on with his/her preferred way of interaction (think of charactor more like fool's gold, and the centre more like real gold).
  likewise, the actor starts to receive energy from the moment/charactor/situation and *transform* that energy into something other than what was received, and put that out instead, making them a "foil" to the character and the situation (think of the actor more like lead and foil more like carbon).

those are the two main foundation ideas that will make this idea a success, because what I want to do is to take wattpad, and do what they do, but better than them (I'm playing the foil and wattpad is the charactor); and I'd like to make this idea available to everyone and make a universe that's *only* fan-fiction where these enkidu can figure out how to make sense of their/our reality in human and bigfoot form. obviously a lot of these narratives (especially the human ones) could end up becoming movies/books/games/etc and there is potetial for rewriting/changing our perception of history -- but that's not my goal yet (there really is a LOT of room to monetise). my main goal is to simply build the universe and make it easy and accessible for people to begin to build up these narratives, because (you'll find out later) that the way that enkidu is summoned is through narrative and I have a feeling that (if it isn't already happening), people will begin summoning their own enkidu lovers and friends for theirselves.
  I'm not sure if you're familiar with the epic of gilgamesh (if not, check out [snake-bros version](http://www.brothersoftheserpent.com/2018/09/postponed-till-thursday.html) @[youtube](https://youtu.be/PYhrrXqwVMc)). in the story, gilgamesh has a dream about enkidu coming, and his mom interprets the dream for him, telling him to *expect* this strong powerful equal to show up. he did, and was a wildman. enkidu gets tamed by a prostitute for 1-2 weeks (depending on the narrative), and later he and gil went on exploits together, were best pals, etc. it's a touching story, but the important part to note is that these guys are summoned through narrative. when they're born of women, in the conception process, if enkidu's symbolic system is compatible enough, they'll take on an X and look and behave like humans do (mostly), but are locked into the social-cultural-framework of where they're born into (until they figure out how to access/use enkidu's capabilites). however, if they're just appearing (like enkidu did), he'll be very bigfoot-like.

eventually, I want to turn this whole universe into a game with large battling robots and biological entites (like us) with "magic" (shapeshifting,summoning,etc) capabilites that are sentient (like us) and/or controlled/augmented by computers over a sort of galactic-wide network of concepts. (that's many years down the road though)
  for now though, I thought I'd just put the idea out there and see what you think. I have the idea written down (sparsly) in a github repository which [you can see here](https://github.com/heavyk/new-setup). the relevant sections are going to be in, "in-27-days" where I think about the idea and "enkidu-do" (cause he's got an action-plan) -- and the rest is mental dribble, thuogh I'll want to integrate some of the other ideas like the "blartr" conceept as well, to begin illustrating the narrative, not just with text, but with visual/interactive concepts.

### 2023-06-14 17:29 - hearing and listening

the other day I noticed I spelled your name wrong, but then I just hated the way it looked when I changed the spelling on it. I finally decided that I wanted to change it back to "misspelled" and when I did, I noticed that "alison" sounds to me like "ali-son" (like muhammed ali's son), and that didn't sound like you at all. instead when it has two l's: "allison", it sounds to me like "I'll lissen" (the way americans pronounce "listen": with a silent 't').

as I thought about what I wrote in the commit message where I changed it back, I was trying to piece together a good way of explaining what I mean by "listening" vs "hearing". hearing is symbols and words: the literal meaning; however most people (you'll notice, especially after talking with me a bit), *do not mean the same thing* when they say the same words.
  as a child, this very fact, *drove me completely nuts!!* because one person would say one thing and mean one thing, and another would say the same thing and mean another. I wanted the world to speak to me like a computer does: plain and full of intention for me to understand with clarity *what they're trying to say*.
    --- TODO
  as I grew older, my ability to "listen" to the person became less and less, as I started to try and make *symbolic* sense of what everyone was telling me (I just assumed that everyone was trying to communicate clearly with me), and consequently I lost more and more hope for my ability to communicate with people. depression started to set in, and I started to sink into stronger and stronger emotional swings
    some people (I noticed) in this phase often turn to pets and animals, as it feels like they're the only ones with a "true" communication that isn't always trying to take advantage and manipulate with words/symbol. I didn't go so much for the animals though, and instead developed a *very* strong desire to learn how to program a computer.
  once I had my brain haemorrhage and all of that I came out of the hospital and learned how to program a computer, and I gatta tell you, it was love at first experience: here's a thing where 100% of my actions (written in code) are *my fault*, and not anyone else's. I have full control over how the machine behaves, and when I communicate with it, it's a clear and defined interface (hopefully, if it's good software/compiler).
  as I continued on to get better and better at programming the computer, it's like a relationship where you gain better and better communication with someone, and the interface gets *clearer* and *increases* in functionality.
    I came to understand that there is such a thing as malware, viruses, and a lot of other "malicious" (self-serving) entities out there in the computer networks, and so I spent a good portion of my life learning cryptography and other such "measures" -- and really, the conclusion that I came to is that, I can never "verify" or "trust" anyone else, but what I can do is have a way of using 3 or more different instances of myself (my code) to verify that *my* code/data/whatever is what I perceive it to be (whether that's represented as a hash or an abstract picture; doesn't matter, just that it's an other (slightly modified/rerendered/reinterpretted) version of the the same code: the actor).
  dispite my best efforts to find a way to guarantee some symbols outside of me are some way, there just simply isn't any way for me to do anything about anyone else.
however, through a series of unfortunate events, I have learned/developde what I call "conceptual pertception" -- which isn't a new thing, it's just largely underused by anyone in society because it has to do with emotions; emotions happen (for me anyway), when the symbols that I believe were communicated to me, *do not turn out to be the way I imagined them to be*[^failed-expectations] -- and so the large part of perceiving/feeling/knowing what the other person is communicating, is *not* to work in symbol, but to instead perceive/listen to what is their desire; and "their" desire, is actually a reflection of *my* desire/will.

I'm inspired now to tell you about "billy jean": billy (william) jean is a very interesting song, because ... I'll point it out:

> billy jean is not my love;
> she's just a *girl*, that thinks that *I am the one*
> but *the kid* is not *my son*.

I understand that the common way to look at this song is that billy jean is a woman that he slept with and that produced a baby. however, look instead for a moment at the idea that will-iam jean, the girl, the kid, and my son -- are all the same person: what you have is a woman that looks like a man, behaves like a girl and thinks that (whomever is listening to the song) is "the one" -- and (then) takes the place of "the father" saying that "the kid" (billy jean) is not her son. this song is "anatau" or antu/anu/ninhursag (for the sumerians). I found billy jean to be soul-mate (if you will) of "norma jean": look at desire from a man's perspective, and see that everyone wants to find out that they are "the one"...
  billy jean is just a girl who thinks I (the father) am the one, -- but *the kid* (genderless) is not *my son* (the saviour), because I (the father) am not *the one*.
  tl;dr - the "father" (desire) is *all that is*, and we make that desire "one" -- and that "one" is just a (literary/narrative/conversational) aspect into ourselves (ourselves mismo)....
  maybe I'll try this concept again a little later. I'm having trouble putting into words how the many/father/all-that-is becomes "one" in every aspect of ourselves, as a reflection of what that "one" is: (from the one's perxpective) *my* love/cupid (me) (not your love).

listen, and you'll hear your own will/billy/desire in everything you encounter; hear, and you're trapped in the limitations of the symbols as they're presented.

[failed-expectations]: I'm reminded of a part in tesla's autobiographia where he beleived that someone would come and ask him to implement his world system (where he wanted to implement global telepathy: brain to brain connection) and so he got really excited when someone from the company came to his door. he was so sure they'd want to install his world system, that it caused an extreme fit of anger and rage when all they wanted to know is if he thinks he's psychic and can read other's minds (the exact *opposite* of what he wanted to create, but symbolically equivalent: here's his opportunity to prove to the world that we can communicate *brain to brain* -- by showing himself a psychic...) lol

### specialisation: one/duality/many implementation
- if I'm summoned, do I perceive the complete or am I a piece (of the frequency spectrum)
### let's see if we can make a worse one, though...
### first thing I would want
