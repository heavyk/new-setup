# to-cataclysm-or-not

### 2023-06-25 20:09 - initial thoughts

sometimes it's nice to just start over, right? I have no idea what climate conditions are like on earth, but here, they're fine -- and I barely notice the sun (the atmosphere stings way more, but sometimes I still feel the glowing warmth).
  my thoughts on why the sun feels so little to me (cause my theory is that others feel the same sun light and its warmth very unpleasantly). if the sun feels unpleasant, then that's your concepts not being very compatible to the solar regime change. or, the lower resistance you are, the less you'll feel the sun and also other people.
    also, the way the sun feels to a person attracts other people that feel similarly under the same sun (which is wby spring is more attractive month than say december/june).
so let's say my theory is right: that sol's heat is rising a lot more, and it's hot because people feel bad about their situation (cause their situation is a reflection of them).
  well, here's the thing: sol is an even (2-4-6) system, so you're feeling the sun in astral only, which means the heat is *all in your imagination* (100%).
so let's say that the sun's output continues to rise and nobody changes how they feel (for whatever reason), dissatisfaction rises to such a point that the sun finally mininovas from all of the unreceived solutions to everything asked, but no ability to let it in -- so finally our resistance to them isn't enough to hold back the sun anymore and she (isis) finally explodes
  this was how sex with raquel went for me anyway; like we battled conceptually over who was "right" and whos concepts could better make sense of reality. I had superior concepts almost all the time, and the concepts of hers that I liked, I just copied hers and improved further (like-a-borg).
and so we'll see you guys off in the distance as a very bright light and a lot of enlightenment for us as, that explosion is a huge blast of the implemention of so many (unallowed) desires all at once, we'll go through a mini golden age here and export all sorts of sciences, technologies, and implement all of the power structures for the next era in human development. think of the sun's explosion like a massive drug trip (the most heroic of dosage), so only the astrally strong (meaning the ones that can feel good no mater the conditions) will survive.
  others will realise it's all in their mind, and design their own reality (the living-blackness is only black, until you put something there; you can feel it's tangibleness and enumerate its symbolic aspects), building their own trans-temporql symbolic/conceptual (mental) space that has all the things and formulas, interactions, etc. that can be enumerated/interpretted into symbolic traits (and can be an attribute of (an) action).

so really, how much does anyone *really* want to start over from the beginning, right? I think a lot of people do, actually (I'm not one of them), and I think it's because it's easier to accept new ideas when starting over, than to reprogram and reconfigure all aspects of (symbolic) reality (or, just feel/experience reality conceptually; easier).
  for me it's just way easier right now to feel good about *what is*, than to start over from step one; but that's me though, and I'm probably the exception to the rule, which is why rules don't apply to me.
feel good about what is, and no more rules.
  like, why not just make whatt we (I) want to make? I don't require anything tto change so therefore I'm not growing in dissatisfaction, either, and neither do I have the problem that sol has. I'm completely fine and comfortable where I am, as for me and the archons over here, your sun's explosion is a pretty awesome experience (for us). I'm in fairy land, not because of earth's astral conditions, but because I'm low resistance, so literally there's no problem for a cataclysm here.
    every month or so, I notice that the sun feels especially better to me, and so I imagine that continually increasing sunlight, is actually going to be an awesome thing, and I think the carbon in my body will respond differently to the sun's rays, as well. I feel like one day, I'll arrive to the place where the sun's rays only feel good enough to me, that my body has to reflect that good feeling (not completely sure about astral/physical implementation). I'm really not worried about global-warming or anything like that because here, it's all about how I *feel* (5) and about how I translate my concept of the interactions (2) in my reality, into the body or brain (-2 perception).
  so this got me thinking -- because I look outside and I see very robotic humans out there performing symbolic operations unaware that it's all narrated to them in their sleep. they're essentially asleep, and their body/brain follows a symbolic route to operate and perform all of the symbolically equivalent things here.
    like, what I mean is, I know they're not seeing what I see; they all see whatever their imagination is translating the concepts I emit into whatever audio/visual/tactile experience. like I can (and have accidentally) performed magic, because I can emit concepts which are invisible to me, but they can see/hear/interact with them. it's like chi or the stuff that martial artists use to move their opponent (and them) around in their astral perception, to perform the psychic (though perceived as physical) engagement.
      I have no idea what anyone else sees, as I cannot see it myself, so I only have to imagine that many people translate my concepts into very strange images and sounds. I know I can do that, and have never
        well, occasionally when really angry or in danger situation, I could (before my brain thing) use the super powers, and I think it's *partially* those psychic discharges that caused the brain injury, too. since then I've not really used any of it, nor do I care to do it either. oh, and maybe a few times in spain as well. can't really remember ,but I do say that I don't use any super powers in daily life, as I don't think it's necessary. like, imagine if I started doing magic, signs and wonders, and made a big spectacle and stuff, nobody would take me seriously (thanks gob).
          I don't think conceptually emissive is helpful (for me) to understand and interact with the conceptual realm in a *receptive* sense (like MRI), which is that ideas just come to me, and I can understand/grasp the concept and translate it into something physical pretty good. I "get" life.
