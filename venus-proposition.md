### 2023-12-21 06:43 - thinking about the option


I'm watching "as you like it", and I'm realising that orlando reminds me a whole lot of jaron. then, I realise that I'm much more aligned with touchstone than anything else. I'm a great foil, and so because touhstone is so similar to rosalind, I'm realising that symbolically I'm most closely aligned with rosalind in this play. I'm ganymede in boy form and rosalind in girl form (kinda). everything is just a giant show -- and this is the format that I'm able to be a 1st ray, in physical form. I want to be 1st ray in perception, but the confinements of physical don't allow me to be a man very easily. I really would need to get rid of the nuts if I were to stay a man... and I guess that's not wanted or something because I'd be like superman because I get the energy directly from the earth instead of from the reactions the testes make to symbolic systems (ie, the narrative way reality is supposed to work, as programmed by venus). if I lose my balls, then they lose me. so apparently to avoid that, there's a new propoxal that we were working on tonight. it basically is the outline of this play. I basically become rosalind and jaron is orlando. there will be all of this crazy stuff, but I'll just play a pre-teen girl (up to his heart he says) and then just be me. I probably won't really age, cause I'll be a reflection of my conceptual level, and because it'd be impossible for anyone to conceive of a 1yo saying things that I say, I'll take on the form of the average minimum age for my perception (in everyone else's eyes) -- I'm hoping somewhere in the 9-11yo range. then for as long as "adam" (another aspect of myself) is in his late 80's -- and let's say the girl is born in 2020, she'll turn 50 (boomin' grannies), right about when I'm in my late 80's. I won't look 80 though, or act like it (like I said: 9-11yo range), and when I turn back into man, I'll have the appearance of the common most desireable form; I'll be very beautiful to everyone. then, we'll finally make the union. the next year, we can do something entirely different, but it'll be the sam5 setup: 1000 girls (50yos this year), along with 24 "elders" which participate, but in a different way than the others. they don't need to be pretty either. they're respected and desired by the girls (including myself). they're like the matriarches, and so upon that I'm sure many a power structure will be built. the next time that the sun dances around us again next year we can do something different.
I dunno, sounds good to me. I'll go with a tenative "yes", until I discover an implication that bothers me. upon which time, I'll figure out a new way to look at it and find a way to feel good. I like that actually, because it'll be a mirror of my beginning time with jaron. I'll just find new ways to look at the situation and feel good about it. also, of note, I'm realising I need to have a look at "merchant of venice" -- because then jaron is bassanio. well, what can I say other than, "I'll keep that in mind".
I've made a decision since I woke up this evening that, I'll just go though and watch shakespere and make comments on it. everyone likes him so much that I feel a strange pulse when I'm "decoding" his narrative.
	you know what I think it is, is that mars back in 1600 created his own narrative manifestation. 1600 is a long time ago, and we think that nothing really major ever happened, but there are strange things in the mormon tradition relating to the scorching of the americas. I think it happened, and I think it's the sun, as well.
	combine the mormon tradition with the apocalyptic events narrated to have happened, we can imagine that somewhere by the time of 1650 or so, something catastrophic happened in the americas relating to the sun. it was likely happening at night in london, so prolly day in the americas. back then, they didn't have electricity, so even if a massive CME hit, it would only create a massive tempest, as nearly all of the oxygen in the air falls down in the form of massive amounts of water (localised of course).
		you know, this makes me wonder, if the side of the earth that got hit by the x-ray burst from the flare, is more likely to be the side the CME impacts on (or what most common angle gradient).
	anyway, whatever became of him, we don't really know, but obviously our timeline doesn't include him in it -- or does it? if it did, then he'd be the big beast, and I'm the little image imitator of him -- or maybe jaron is the imitator of me -- or both. that would make me vulcan, which is who I thought I was from the getgo (and obviously anatau was imported when I was 16). symbolically, I prolly do align more with vulcan/ganymede, but in practicality, I've got all 3: hence the 1-2-5-7 configuration.
so I go about reading these plays, I'm just going to be as touchstone as possible on them; because there's a lot that's not very likeable. that was what original mars thought was the manifestion that he wanted, and me, showing up because I was narratively summoned, appears that I have to repeat his manifestaion verbaitm, or I could just do what I want, duh :)
