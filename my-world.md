# my-world

### 2023-06-24 15:42 - what is lyra like?

I had what felt like a number of reactions wondering what my world is like... maybe I'll try and take pictures or something. everyone looks completely normal though, so I don't really see any difference that could possibly be there. the only difference that I can possibly see is with regards to behaviour: everyone does what they believe, so I can say that I see everyone's "ideal" or heavenly self.
  as an example, if someone thinks that they're doing xyz, then to me that's what it appears like they're doing (whether they are or not in their imaginary world or not, I can't tell), so everyone looks like they're trying their hardest to get everything they want accomplished, and (I don't know if it's me or not), but the results of what they're trying to accomplish reflect their *feeling* (concepts and beliefs), and not the action.
    for example, when I watch jaron, he's honestly doing all of the stuff that he thinks he's doing (in his imaginary world), but in my world the results for what he's looking for directly correspond to how he feels: for example, he believes that mom is xyz and so mom behaves exactly that way, and then when I take over mom's duty, because he doesn't believe xy (but maybe still z) about me, the experience goes a lot differently for him.
therefore, (though I live in "heaven") I live in a world where everything exists exactly as everyone believes it does. it's kinda funny to watch everyone going around fulfilling their own beliefs about theirselves (what they believe will happen when abc happens (the action-plan))
  living in a world where all reality is whatever you believe it is, is great for the archons because they all believe they have tons of power and control because they cOntrol the astral layer, and so wheaver they believe and the narrative that they want to affect, they can superimpose their belief (3rd ray) over reality (6th ray) for anyone on earth; in a sense, they're in narrative control over how different symbols connect to each other, and so therefore shape how the action-plan of how society, govenrnment, and organisations work just by giving them an "image" (branding, marketing, propaganda) -- and each one does this for the power structure that they're in charge of. the archons and their narrative functions as a replacement for 2nd ray aspect that the sun has.
    so notice what's happening: in sol, the 2nd ray aspect comes from the sun, which is pulling them toward the implementation of what's wanted, however the narrative 2nd ray reality created by the archons in lyra is superimposed on top (4/6th ray) and so on earth, if you're follow your sensations, you're living the narrative realitty imposed by the archons, but if you find a way to follow your emotions instead, you're receiving (5th ray) reality which connects to the sol's 2nd ray reality (bypassing the archons).
      the archons are only there because people still want a prophetic or narrative reality where they can essentially attract an enkidu (from this world) to join them in their earthly 4d reality, and that enkidu is controlled here symbolically by the archons -- so while they're trying to be everything you want them to be, they're stuck in the narrative matrix of their own beliefs, and the way the narrative for our culture/society/etc is the way the narrators say it is. (obviously japanese narrators are different than american or african narrators (that is those that see from enkidu's prespective, here on lyra)).

there are essentially 3 different types of people that I've noticed so far (perhaps 4):
1. those that see 4d and are fully in the narrative (hyper attractive according to the symbol/narrative/beliefs) realiity, where the reality is a reflection (attracted) based on their narrative. I've noticed that nearly *all* gay men I've noticed are this way -- including *all* women. I'd say this is the 99%.
2. those that are *really high* **up** in 4d (and spectral) which create the narrative. these are the 1%; the archons (whether they know it or not).
3. those that are like me (I'm probably the only one right now, but soon, it it hasn't already) to be many more, and that is that they see lyra (the ideal/believed to be version of everyone) -- and if they're low resistance they'll see the low resistance ideal, meanwhile if they're high resistance, they'll see the high resistance ideal of anyone they encounter. these are the enkidu. I know (because I see them outside), that *everyone* has this perspective, they just don't see it because they see 4d, which is all of their beliefs manifested.
  I get my beliefs manifested too, but because I don't have an imaginary/visual system, where I see what I want to see, my beliefs (and the belief of X-attractive/women/etc I'm around) get manifested in the form of real-life action and manifestations. right now, it's just interactions, but eventually it'll include things that "defy/break the laws of physics" -- and it's because here is all based on belief, so anything anyone believes very strongly will get manifested around me.
    I'm great because I can see positive aspects in everything from child abuse to dictators, and so others' belief in those things don't manifest any further than government and private systems which are symbolically (to me) similar in oppressiveness, which I/we live under, thanks mostly to everyone else's belief. I focus the manifestation of that belief into something that's usually pretty fine, but the new highly reflective kids these days (and other enkidu) are going to fulfill/attract the most believed in reality by those who have attracted anyone: you want cataclysm, there's an enkidu/archon that's got your 4d reality ready for you; they're like me, pure desire for anyone they encounter (remember, I look out the window and see all kinds of enkidu out here, so we all are pure desire (cupid) in our lyra body, even if were not aware if it).

you know, I really honestly believe that our two worlds are connected by the great pyramid (giza) complex, and that's what makes the reality that we both see be sorta like "modulated" through venus (saturn's consort), which is why some (venusian) people are more narrative than others are.
  there is a request that I (kenny) am not narratively connected to 4d earth, and that's totally fine with me (I get the privacy issue), and there are a lot of other advantages as well, but eventually, my desire and reflective nature is going to become harmful to others' realities. when it's time, the great pyramid (on my end) will be decomissioned (probably by me), allowing our worlds to separate. I think this is the narrative hanging of thoth.
    you'll all live out your narrative realities (which is all super awesome -- because *I want everyone to figure it out for theirselves* -- no saviouring from me, sorry). some will join me in my position, and ultimately do what I'm going to do, in their own narrative way (if they were me) -- which is also *figuring it out for theirselves* (again, awesome).
you know I'm super stoked about this because you all get to do it your way, which really is a relief for me, because I *do not* want to be telling anyone what to think, say, or do. I speak to everyone in the way it comes out of my mouth
  english is different for me than spanish, because in english I use words and phrases that sound like *I* **know** what I'm talking about (translated-with-certainty), however in spanish, because I'm not as good at translating concepts into that language, I don't have the same certainty in my voice, and I sound a lot more unsure (because I don't know if the word is the right translation). spanish is really a limiting language for me when it comes to this stuff.
