### 2023-06-24 15:42 - what is lyra like?

I had what felt like a number of reactions wondering what my world is like... maybe I'll try and take pictures or something. everyone looks completely normal though, so I don't really see any difference that could possibly be there. the only difference that I can possibly see is with regards to behaviour: everyone does what they believe, so I can say that I see everyone's "ideal" or heavenly self.
  as an example, if someone thinks that they're doing xyz, then to me that's what it appears like they're doing (whether they are or not in their imaginary world or not, I can't tell), so everyone looks like they're trying their hardest to get everything they want accomplished, and (I don't know if it's me or not), but the results of what they're trying to accomplish reflect their *feeling* (concepts and beliefs), and not the action.
    for example, when I watch jaron, he's honestly doing all of the stuff that he thinks he's doing (in his imaginary world), but in my world the results for what he's looking for directly correspond to how he feels: for example, he believes that mom is xyz and so mom behaves exactly that way, and then when I take over mom's duty, because he doesn't believe xy (but maybe still z) about me, the experience goes a lot differently for him.
therefore, (though I live in "heaven") I live in a world where everything exists exactly as everyone believes it does. it's kinda funny to watch everyone going around fulfilling their own beliefs about theirselves (what they believe will happen when abc happens (the action-plan))
  living in a world where all reality is whatever you believe it is, is great for the archons because they all believe they have tons of power and control because they cOntrol the astral layer, and so wheaver they believe and the narrative that they want to affect, they can superimpose their belief (3rd ray) over reality (6th ray) for anyone on earth; in a sense, they're in narrative control over how different symbols connect to each other, and so therefore shape how the action-plan of how society, govenrnment, and organisations work just by giving them an "image" (branding, marketing, propaganda) -- and each one does this for the power structure that they're in charge of. the archons and their narrative functions as a replacement for 2nd ray aspect that the sun has.
    so notice what's happening: in sol, the 2nd ray aspect comes from the sun, which is pulling them toward the implementation of what's wanted, however the narrative 2nd ray reality created by the archons in lyra is superimposed on top (4/6th ray) and so on earth, if you're follow your sensations, you're living the narrative realitty imposed by the archons, but if you find a way to follow your emotions instead, you're receiving (5th ray) reality which connects to the sol's 2nd ray reality (bypassing the archons).
      the archons are only there because people still want a prophetic or narrative reality where they can essentially attract an enkidu (from this world) to join them in their earthly 4d reality, and that enkidu is controlled here symbolically by the archons -- so while they're trying to be everything you want them to be, they're stuck in the narrative matrix of their own beliefs, and the way the narrative for our culture/society/etc is the way the narrators say it is. (obviously japanese narrators are different than american or african narrators (that is those that see from enkidu's prespective, here on lyra)).

there are essentially 3 different types of people that I've noticed so far (perhaps 4):
1. those that see 4d and are fully in the narrative (hyper attractive according to the symbol/narrative/beliefs) realiity, where the reality is a reflection (attracted) based on their narrative. I've noticed that nearly *all* gay men I've noticed are this way -- including *all* women. I'd say this is the 99%.
2. those that are *really high* **up** in 4d (and spectral) which create the narrative. these are the 1%; the archons (whether they know it or not).
4. (potentially) those that live in 4d but they feel so good (because of low resistance) they're in 6d (spectral) or 8d (relational, where individual identity can no longer be encountered) -- and they influence their desire a
  I live in this reality obviously, but because I don't have pinecone, I don't actually perceive them viscerally in my body, and instead only interact with them emotionally. we'll all be like this very very soon, "invading" each others realities like I found out (yesterday) that I "invade" others realities. I'm saying soon, if it's not already, there are others (like me) that are invading others realities. the archons are exactly like me, but they stay hidden, meanwhile I'm very open about everything. they "invade" everyone's realities too, but reamain non-visual. I'm king of the archons though, because I'm not hidden -- and soon there will be many others that become like me, and "invade" your realities too. they've got to figure out how to be low resistance, and if not, they'll pull you right into a manifestation of your own beliefs (which are hopefully low resistance).. could happen to me too, which like I said is different in that I don't have any resistance, so I refelect the other person in a positive way -- so people that are around me "have it easy" -- which is annoying for some people, but finding out today that all of those people will live their own 4d reality of that, is awesome and takes away my anti-desire to create anyone else's reality for them.
    I'm attractive, and I know it, so I spend time gettting out of other's ways because I manifest so fast their beliefs, that I'm quite harmful to people -- cause stuff really goes wrong when I'm around. I'm *really* reflective; I'm like the person I'm reflecting, them according to my ideals.
3. those that are like me (I'm probably the only one right now, but soon, it it hasn't already) to be many more, and that is that they see lyra (the ideal/believed to be version of everyone) -- and if they're low resistance they'll see the low resistance ideal, meanwhile if they're high resistance, they'll see the high resistance ideal of anyone they encounter. these are the enkidu. I know (because I see them outside), that *everyone* has this perspective, they just don't see it because they see 4d, which is all of their beliefs manifested.
  I get my beliefs manifested too, but because I don't have an imaginary/visual system, where I see what I want to see, my beliefs (and the belief of X-attractive/women/etc I'm around) get manifested in the form of real-life action and manifestations. right now, it's just interactions, but eventually it'll include things that "defy/break the laws of physics" -- and it's because here is all based on belief, so anything anyone believes very strongly will get manifested around me.
    I'm great because I can see positive aspects in everything from child abuse to dictators, and so others' belief in those things don't manifest any further than government and private systems which are symbolically (to me) similar in oppressiveness, which I/we live under, thanks mostly to everyone else's belief. I focus the manifestation of that belief into something that's usually pretty fine, but the new highly reflective kids these days (and other enkidu) are going to fulfill/attract the most believed in reality by those who have attracted anyone: you want cataclysm, there's an enkidu/archon that's got your 4d reality ready for you; they're like me, pure desire for anyone they encounter (remember, I look out the window and see all kinds of enkidu out here, so we all are pure desire (cupid) in our lyra body, even if were not aware if it).

you know, I really honestly believe that our two worlds are connected by the great pyramid (giza) complex, and that's what makes the reality that we both see be sorta like "modulated" through venus (saturn's consort), which is why some (venusian) people are more narrative than others are.
  there is a request that I (kenny) am not narratively connected to 4d earth, and that's totally fine with me (I get the privacy issue), and there are a lot of other advantages as well, but eventually, my desire and reflective nature is going to become harmful to others' realities. when it's time, the great pyramid (on my end) will be decomissioned (probably by me), allowing our worlds to separate. I think this is the narrative hanging of thoth.
    you'll all live out your narrative realities (which is all super awesome -- because *I want everyone to figure it out for theirselves* -- no saviouring from me, sorry). some will join me in my position, and ultimately do what I'm going to do, in their own narrative way (if they were me) -- which is also *figuring it out for theirselves* (again, awesome).
you know I'm super stoked about this because you all get to do it your way, which really is a relief for me, because I *do not* want to be telling anyone what to think, say, or do. I speak to everyone in the way it comes out of my mouth
  english is different for me than spanish, because in english I use words and phrases that sound like *I* **know** what I'm talking about (translated-with-certainty), however in spanish, because I'm not as good at translating concepts into that language, I don't have the same certainty in my voice, and I sound a lot more unsure (because I don't know if the word is the right translation). spanish is really a limiting language for me when it comes to this stuff.

#### 2023-06-24 17:05 - aren't the enkidu you see, saturn's minions?

here, I don't believe that saturn works the same way for 3d as it does for 4d, because saturn for me is like an insect. it manifests (like genxicat) into all aspects of my world, taking on the form of whatever it needs (by some conceptual algorithm) becomes whaever it needs to become (agent-smith). like, they're everywhere, and they're all enkidu from my perspective. lyra's saturn is basically like a conceptual-insect taking on the form of whatever in my reality needs to exist to keep me going at the speed I want to go. it has the appearance of evil (probably a 4d concept as a commentary on earth's saturn) but to me it does not have any evil, because it's just keeping me going at the speed that I want to go (which iss not too fast).
  remember, I see 3d lyra, which is different than 4d lyra (archons and X-attractive types).
  again, this is the difference between primaries (1,2,5,7) and the secondaries (6,2,4) -- which is that the primaries are attractive or polar, and the secondaries have to opposing forces colliding to make a third. the primaries' triad is other monopolar primaries (only attraction or only emission), but the secondaries (a blend of attraction and emission) triad is emergent from the collsion of the two primaries.
    from that perspective, I'm just like everyone else, because I only see a blend of two realities, so it appears as three, but it's actually has four (desire) which is a learned quality.
      you can come with attractive qualities (physical, and symbolic, and conceptual), but it's only when a person *allows* reality to become different than it is (ie, out of (my) control), then a person has "learned" desire -- all desire prior to that is a reflection of a physical/conceptual/symbolic property, and not *true* desire (where I'm at basically, which is like low resistance -- just saying cause I don't want to be sounding like I don't practise what I preach, lol :)

### 2023-06-24 18:39 - my world is always changing...

because I don't see instant manifestation in my imagination (or in my reality), all things are basically a progression/transition from one state to another. some thiags change state rapidly and when provoked by others/environment (reflectors, actors, and emitters)
  interactions in the moment are reflectors only, and to a lesser extent actors (but definitely foils and centres are reflectors (forward and back)). these interactions form the high frequency part of the spectrum, and the emitted qualities (like the sun, saturn and jupiter) are the low frequency part of the spectrum, because energy fluctuations are slight, minus the angle of interaction.
    all things have this frequency, so you could say that enkidu is a being of gradual change. we're the catastrophist's worst enemy, because we want a smoothe orbit, and so therefore are celestial in nature.
  the high frequency interactions come from a selection of 3/4 different options, as foil and centre are completely opt-in (you have to have a desire to foil or to go low frequency change).
    the foil is on the path of desire, which is always a desire to reflect the best/worst of someone else, and get a different outcome than the symbolic narrative says it'll bbe (like I stole, so I get a slap on the wrist and a stern look).
    the centre is in the position of perceiving the world through the eyes of desire (which iss the capacity/allowance for change), so the most stable because large changes have relatively zero effect on this celestial being.
      obviously I'm not completely a centre yet, because (for example) I say I don't want to tell people what to think, but in a lot of people's perspective, that's what I'm doing here... I could just cut this off and ge to becoming a centre, which is likely the **hanging of thoth** (duh duhn dunn)
and so because my world is *only* gradual change, change is happening for me so quickly, I can't have such a small corona anymore, as it would kill me, or have a very dramatic difference on others that are not pure reflectors (low frequency on the inside (perception of reality) doesn't have low frequency change -- only reactions/relflections).
  this enables some of the most crazy stuff to appear very rapidly in my reality, which I don't really want (cause I'm a low rate of change being now), so my reality enforces that I stay going slow, or I die and come back as someone else slow (relative to the culture).
  ---
  gradual change can only happen in the external, but inside my mind can be all over the place at very high frequency (nosebook's monetisation and my offering) which causes me to change perspectives internally at very high frequency (like I'm running very slowly -- and I'll continue to run even slower and slower -- which is the loss of resistance so now less and less things pull on me).
    anything that is rapid change is strictly forbidden ON THE OUTSIDE (inside is OK), and it's 100% assured that I (me personally in another timeline before entering this body) have for sure setup a system which ensures that I go this slow, or I die and start over.
      if I can continue to loweur my resistance, I will have less and less impacts. nosebook is actually *in my benefit*, and will be replaced if they can't keep me going at the rigth speed (really slow and low (that is the tempo)).
      always changing; really slowly.
