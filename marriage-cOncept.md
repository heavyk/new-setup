### 2023-06-24 20:36 - (desire) in a nutshell

my primary concern (if I'm going to be going this (1,6,5,7) setup) is to go never faster than I want to go. like, we've got to find a way to ensure that I actually go slower and slower with time. for me, this happens because of non-resistance, so the idea would be to ensure that the girls continue to add in difficulty to slow things down.
  later on, my desire is to move into an insect species. in this species, we wouldn't have a inner 6th/astral layer (pinecone) because we're simply going too fast to be able to see in astral. I propose either 2nd (8d) or spectral (6d) as an alternative to astral, because I'll basically kill myself if I see that much too quickly. it's like the ultimate ego death, because I *see* all of my life's concepts pass before my eyes, and if I can't feel good about some of them (meaning I can't react in a short period of time, it feels really bad, and the body ceases its connection to its source (short circuit)). I personally, would prefer to remain in physical (7th ray) for as long as I possibly can, because that's what I want to do: simply be a reflector.
    I realise that I reflect some people better than others, so for me, this marriage-concept is mostly just like a sort of staging. like, you want to have at least one alternate refinery all setup and running before enabling the new primary -- meaning that we want to have a stable state before commencing.
      in order to do this, propose that we wait until 07-07-202? to actually consumate the marriage, because of the reasons I mentioned above (because for me and anyone in my place, this is nearly certain death, as I definitely *do not* feel good about everything that she feels good about, *for sure*)... I have no way to calculate when that will be. (problem for future-JD)
originally my desire is to construct the insect race, which has built in 2nd ray capability (like me), and so the desire there is that I DON'T WANT TO BE 2nd ray. I want to be 1st ray, so this has to be planned for as well (obviously she can be 2nd) -- and pair with my Y (like a binary+ star system).
  the motive behind this desire is found in that if I/we become an insect race (of essentially stars), we will all go (as a group) REALLY SLOWLY. (there's that gradualist's wet dream again: billions and billions and billions of years evolving, lol)
the idea behind the insect race is designed to be a smoothe transition, as we'll all start to become more and more similar and synchronised with each other. (we'll do the universe next; one step at a time; no big jumps)

any marriage that happens resonates with that desire in some way or another (cause that's what I want).
  anyone that wants anothing differently, let's just call that "early access" as they're alpha testing the insect species (in my present state). first time's the charm, right?
    I expect another time we'll do this again in 2034 as well (second time/week is the charm, right).
      and then on to the third time again in 2056 (cause I've heard 3rd time/week is the charm).
        a fourth week? I figure by then we're pretty much masters of own reality by then, and don't need to schedule any more testing phases, as we've got it working as intended by that point.
          too far out to see it clearly, so we'll just have to wait and see, then adjust accordingly.
