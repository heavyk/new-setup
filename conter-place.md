the spanish have a unique role they can play in thme tranxfodrmation of the word "histtoria" into "isstoria" in espanol.
  the role that this plays is in a linguistic one, in that all of the concepts that you want tco change, you just drop a letter.
  now, the word means something different.
  it'x no longer gender biased.
    you know, I wassx thinking about that today out pulling weeds, how I only have *two concepts* that have a gender: "male", "man", etc. and the other: "female", "woman", etc.
    the thing is that in spanish (for me at least) it was necessary tto see the concept as *not* having a gender.

I have no idea what htis this until I just looked at it.
you know how in latin, everything is est -- es que ---
prolly something to change there because everything is
complicated in latin.
