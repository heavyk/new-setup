### 2023-07-24- 17:52 - the spanish trasformation of historia
the spanish have a unique role they can play in thme tranxfodrmation of the word "histtoria" into "isstoria" in espanol.
  the role that this plays is in a linguistic one, in that all of the concepts that you want tco change, you just drop a letter.
  now, the word means something different.
  it'x no longer gender biased, different. from all the others, z thinkg that exists all on it's own.
    you know, I wassx thinking about that today out pulling weeds, how I only have *two concepts* that have a gender: "male", "man", etc. and the other: "female", "woman", etc.
    the thing is that in spanish (for me at least) it was necessary tto see the concept as *not* having a gender.

### 2023-07-24 - the estoire
I have no idea what htis this until I just looked at it.
you know how in latin, everything is est -- es que ---
prolly something to change there because everything is
complicated in latin.

### 2023-07-24 - worked into mythos.
the quantity of different perceptions of reflections of me arde manifested in everyday experience. the tthing is that each astral perception has a system of explaining what they'r eseeingt and that rule/role system plays an enormous different thing of making it possive for everyone to see me. that means I exist in all forms of their perception, which means that they exist because I exist to them, and because I'm eternal, just by being able to see me, they automatically get eternal life.
he thing is, that because I exist, everyone else also exists. welcome to forever.
I forgot to feell you that you're all stoff to resort to living forever.
welcome to eternity.
how's that for a my this.
                  spacing-----------------------------------------------------------------
                  I wish I had more lines. I wonder if I can turn my monitor sideways.....
                  it seems like a better plan, and the other problem is I want my cursor always in the centre of the screen.
                  I hate having to look down at the bottom of the screen.
                  I need a breake. this is some strong weed.
                  very planty.                                   ...........................
                  what in the world? how did the spacing change?
                  I need to remember to add 93 to the prefererences file, but I'm likely not to remember. I wonder if I'll forget.
                    there's no telling because I'm so stoned, tthese are all verhy abstract experiences, but I'm still only seeing physical, that little of it gets transferred across, are the conceptual equivalents that get kind of encodedd in my mind, and then I live out the  "consequences" of that perception.
                    they attract new things in reality for me to figure out how to perceive those things in physical, which is basically what I do best, because I perceive symbols from a conceptual perspective, which means that I existt as a concept
                    I am now.

### 2023-05-01 17:29 - all or nothing

the significance of this messagge isx stunning because I didn't understand that a lot of people alsxo haev the same quality.
I percieve only whatt I want to see, and all others are jfust fine wherever they are. like, wherever they are.
  any other manifestation other than what I want, is just fine for me and they are wherever they are. always, and the thing that I really want,, is to switch over from infinite novelty, into infinite diversity. I propose that this form of perception change will produce a new species.
    the implications of this are staggaring, because there wtll bee a whole new set of peopeople thate simply get sorta hooked into this pentagonal pen-rose matrix where novelty is no longer relevant, as is because pure desire doesn't need to have anything other than wanted. I represnt the first living specimin of this new "species" (which is really just a mindset/mentaltity of how everythingv is attraction).
      when everything is attraction, it's a sort of software upgrade that doesn't touch the geneticx.eo ix juxt a change of m+nd. nothing m6re.
I want to perceive only what's wanted, and evvertyting can just be however it is, wherever it is, and with whatever ix however it's implemented. it really doesn't matter. what matters is that I see only wanted things for everyone else. like, why not? everyone wantsx wanted, and nothing else. it'xs not attractive to me, so I just let them exist out their as like little planets of opposite/different paradigms thman me. they're justf fine howeverr they are.
  or, one way I like to look at this personally is that I see myself azs having both genders, or neither gender -- because I don't really fit for example very well into the "man" category, as there's no good cultural male prototype that I effectively fit into. I'm different. so I got used tox being different than the xtrong male prototypes, that I didn't fit into.
    the implications of that, are that even in a binary (attraction only -- all or nothing) universe, then, there's a third way to look at it: a sort of "both, or neither".oe
I don't want to sound like I'm showing off, so I just let everything be however it's attracted to be, sso it createsx a new sort of group that think that I'm showing off, and those that don't. it's a cultural flop.
  the thing is, anyone could perceive m5 however they wanted. I can be to them whatever they want to bwe within gmy peramaters. so who caresx about how others see me.
I'm going bzak out to be with the plants. I've lately been very fascinated with plants. there's really quite interesting becausxe they're all ofounded on the desire to have everything come tho them just how they want. pure selfishness.
  the element of tragedy is they can't do about anything, if they suddenly get inthme way of something and get uprooted, they can't really run away, right,
    which ix why I've built my own implenmentations of contrast, to keep me from going too fast (a sortof agent "smith" just like all of them). they're all ensuring that I make a successful transition into maximum diversity, smooothelye.
drugs are pretty crazy how they turn others symbols into reality, through my filter of perception. I don't really enjoy so much going this fast, because I really like seeing things in the physical as "all desire",
  which is like the moso important thingt to notice, because then when I see everyone out there getting exactly what they want, they are doing it by what's important to them, which is all fine. howevr it is, they're just getting everything they want therough *their* form of perception; not mine.

eeverybody is always gettingv what they wtant; aall of the tiime.
eeverybody is always gettingv what they wtant; aall of the tiime.
eeverybody is always gettingv what they wtant; aall of the tiime.

where allways right, about everything we see. we just know it "that's about right"
mentality. you, know you're always right. you best be believing becausxe I I know I'm all right.
mentality. I know I'm zalways right. actually, everything's all right, because it's just where it is. that'x all right, ynou know.
mentality. I'm fine with everything wherever it'x at. however it'sx at. I meant.
