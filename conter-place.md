### 2023-07-24- 17:52 - the spanish trasformation of historia
the spanish have a unique role they can play in thme tranxfodrmation of the word "histtoria" into "isstoria" in espanol.
  the role that this plays is in a linguistic one, in that all of the concepts that you want tco change, you just drop a letter.
  now, the word means something different.
  it'x no longer gender biased, different. from all the others, z thinkg that exists all on it's own.
    you know, I wassx thinking about that today out pulling weeds, how I only have *two concepts* that have a gender: "male", "man", etc. and the other: "female", "woman", etc.
    the thing is that in spanish (for me at least) it was necessary tto see the concept as *not* having a gender.

### 2023-07-24 - the estoire
I have no idea what htis this until I just looked at it.
you know how in latin, everything is est -- es que ---
prolly something to change there because everything is
complicated in latin.

### 2023-07-24 - worked into mythos.
the quantity of different perceptions of reflections of me arde manifested in everyday experience. the tthing is that each astral perception has a system of explaining what they'r eseeingt and that rule/role system plays an enormous different thing of making it possive for everyone to see me. that means I exist in all forms of their perception, which means that they exist because I exist to them, and because I'm eternal, just by being able to see me, they automatically get eternal life.
he thing is, that because I exist, everyone else also exists. welcome to forever.
I forgot to feell you that you're all stoff to resort to living forever.
welcome to eternity.
how's that for a my this.
                  spacing-----------------------------------------------------------------
                  I wish I had more lines. I wonder if I can turn my monitor sideways.....
                  it seems like a better plan, and the other problem is I want my cursor always in the centre of the screen.
                  I hate having to look down at the bottom of the screen.
                  I need a breake. this is some strong weed.
                  very planty.  ........     ...............................................
                  what in the world? how did the spacing change?
